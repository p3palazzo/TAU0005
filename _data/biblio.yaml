  abstract: >-
    Among the nearly seventy drawings on parchment preserved from the model book
    of Villard de Honnecourt are a number done in the "chantier" of Reims
    Cathedral, around 1230. They are of great interest, not only as a record of
    the building of the Cathedral, but for what they show of the graphic
    representation of architecture in the late Middle Ages. They include the
    first drawing combining the interior and exterior elevation, the first
    cross-section, and an idiosyncratic representation of the central absidal
    chapel. While Villard does not seem to have been an architect or master
    mason, his volume documents a highly developed graphic capacity. The paper
    is a critical study of the group.

  abstract: >-
    "Roman architecture is extraordinarily rich, both in terms of the techniques
    and materials used and in the variety of buildings constructed, many of
    which are still visible today." "This book places emphasis on the technical
    aspects of that architecture, following the process of building through each
    stage, from quarry to standing wall, from tree to roof timbers. The author
    examines the different techniques involved in building in brick, stone and
    wood, and how these materials were obtained or manufactured. He also
    discusses interior decoration and looks at the practical aspects of water
    supply, heating and roads. Each type of building required special tools and
    these are described, using both surviving examples and modern parallels."
    "The Romans constructed many spectacular feats of engineering, producing
    magnificent monuments such as the Pantheon and Pont du Gard. This book looks
    at these large-scale public buildings but also at more modest homes and
    shops. The result is a thorough and systematic examination of Roman
    building, with over 750 illustrations, including photographs and the
    author's own drawings."--Jacket.

  abstract: >-
    Japan's Ise Shrine is famous for its thirteen-hundred-year-old
    reconstruction tradition, the Shikinen sengu, in which the most sacred
    structures are completely rebuilt every twenty years. The construction
    process incorporates not only the usual elements of planning, materials
    procurement, and installation, but also integrates some thirty Shinto
    rituals that mark important milestones in the construction process. This
    renewal is remarkable because it preserves an ancient architectural style
    that is extremely susceptible to decay as well as the ancient construction
    technologies needed to build it. Because each cycle is very closely modeled
    on its predecessor, the most recent reconstruction, completed in 1993,
    provides a window through which we can examine ancient construction
    attitudes and technologies.

    Recent advances in computer-visualization technology have brought urban
    historians new tools for analyzing the growth of historic cities. This paper
    examines both the prospects and problems involved in using this technology
    to map the development of urban form. Using a computer model of Cairo in two
    different periods of the Middle Ages, the author has attempted to
    reconstruct the physical reality of the city and to animate the city so that
    modern-day observers may experience its principal streets. While the work
    has shown computer simulation to be a significant tool for helping urban
    historians understand the built environments of the past, it has also
    exposed possible pitfalls in the seductive potential of such simulations.

    O objetivo da pesquisa é demonstrar que a cultura Guarani possui uma lógica
    de organização territorial estreitamente relacionada com as características
    do território. Parte-se do conceito de Paisagem Cultural para reconhecer
    essa lógica, e se valora como ao longo da história se produzem sucessivas
    intenções de aculturação, que fundamentalmente se baseiam na pretensão de
    impor modelos urbanos como meio civilizatório. Apesar de todo o processo de
    aculturação, se pretende demonstrar que os Guaranis ainda preservam traços
    de sua antiga organização, servindo como suporte para manter suas tradições
    e seu modo de vida. Neste artigo, apresentamos os padrões culturais dos seus
    assentamentos, baseando-se principalmente nas narrativas de jesuítas, para
    depois comparar com a legislação portuguesa de 1755, que inicia um sistema
    de urbanização utilizando a população indígena como meio de organização e
    defesa do território.

    Universe of Stone shows that the Gothic cathedrals encode a far-reaching
    shift in the way medieval thinkers perceived their relationship with their
    world. For the first time, they began to believe in an orderly, rational
    world that could be investigated and understood. This change marked the
    beginning of Western science and also the start of a long and, indeed,
    unfinished struggle to reconcile faith and reason.

    technology as an essential component of study. Accepting the premise that
    architectural history is a fundamental component to the overall
    architectural learning environment, it is argued that the study of
    construction history will further enhance student knowledge. This hypothesis
    created an opportunity to investigate how the study of construction history
    could be incorporated to strengthen present teaching methods. Strategies for
    teaching architectural history were analyzed with the determination that an
    incorporation of educational instructional design applications using
    object-oriented programming and hypermedia provided the optimal solution.
    This evaluation led to the development of the HISTCON interactive,
    multimedia educational computer program. Used initially to teach 19th
    Century iron and steel construction history, the composition of the program
    provides the mechanism to test the significance of construction history in
    the study of architectural history. Future development of the program will
    provide a method to illustrate construction history throughout the history
    of architecture. The study of architectural history, using a construction
    oriented methodology, is shown to be positively correlated to increased
    understanding of architectural components relevant to architectural history
    and building construction.

    Space syntax is a technique for measuring the relative accessibility of
    different locations in a spatial system which has been loosely partitioned
    into convex spaces. These spaces are approximated by straight lines, called
    axial lines, and the topological graph associated with their intersection is
    used to generate indices of distance, called integration, which are then
    used as proxies for accessibility. The most controversial problem in
    applying the technique involves the definition of these lines. There is no
    unique method for their generation; hence different users generate different
    sets of lines for the same application. In this paper we explore this
    problem, arguing that to make progress, there need to be unambiguous, agreed
    procedures for generating such maps. The methods we suggest for generating
    such lines depend on defining viewsheds, called isovists, which can be
    approximated by their maximum diameters, these lengths being used to form
    axial maps similar to those used in space syntax. We propose a generic
    algorithm for sorting isovists according to various measures, approximating
    them by their diameters and using the axial map as a summary of the extent
    to which isovists overlap (intersect) and are accessible to one another. We
    demonstrate our techniques for the small French town of Gassin used
    originally by Hillier and Hanson in a 1984 book to illustrate the theory,
    exploring different criteria for sorting isovists, and generating different
    axial maps by changing the level of resolution.

    A cidade é uma criação histórica particular, nem sempre existiu, mas começou
    em certo momento da evolução social e pode acabar, ou ser radicalmente
    transformada, em outro momento. Não existe por uma necessidade natural, mas
    por uma necessidade histórica, que tem um início e pode ter um término.
    Torna-se, portanto, importante explicar a origem da cidade no mundo antigo,
    e também na medida do possível o seu destino na hora atual. Ao trazer para a
    língua portuguesa a importante obra de Leonardo Benevolo, História da
    Cidade, a Editora Perspectiva pretende colocar ao alcance do meio
    profissional e interessado, além de um farto material ilustrativo, um
    instrumento básico para a compreensão de como foi possível e o que alimenta
    este fenômeno básico da sociedade e da cultura. Leia também do mesmo autor:

    The provision of adequate quality housing for the mass population has always
    been the major challenge for a rapidly developing country like Malaysia. As
    the country heads towards higher level of urbanization, it is expected to
    face accelerated demand on housing and the associated environmental impacts.
    Only by encouraging the development of more eficient buildings or through
    implementing a holistic construction approach that addressed right from the
    onset of the design stage, harmful environmental impact to the surroundings
    can be mitigated. This paper highlights the potential of applying lexibility
    – a design approach which has been widely adopted in the traditional
    construction – as an inherent design strategy for the modern urban mass
    housing. The proposed design strategy entails open plan that enable retroit
    and reconiguration to be made quickly, economically, and repeatedly, without
    involving excessive site labour, time, and cost; as compared to the
    currently adopted design strategy which is associated with rigid structure,
    interlocking plan, and predetermined function. It makes possible the
    creation of dwellings which may grow old yet without becoming obsolete;
    incorporating the latest design ideas and technologies, yet have a sense of
    history on the Malaysian housing design (the rumah kampung design); allowing
    the communities to live for generations, yet incorporating the potential of
    adaptation. By examining the background research and the fundamental design
    principles, the paper suggests that only dwellings with high degree of
    lexibility may enable the integration of dual aims and principles of
    affordability and sustainability in mass housing, thereby facilitating the
    movement of the country’s construction industry towards mechanization,
    industrialization, and standardization.

  abstract: >-
    For humans, there appears to be a clear link between general intelligence
    and self-control behavior, such as sustained delay of gratification [1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Chimpanzees also delay gratification [10, 11, 12] and
    can be given tests of general intelligence (g) [13, 14, 15], but these two
    constructs have never been compared within the same sample of nonhuman
    animals. We presented 40 chimpanzees with the hybrid delay task (HDT) [16,
    17], which measures inter-temporal choices and the capacity for sustained
    delay of gratification, and the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB), which
    measures g in chimpanzees [13, 14, 15]. Importantly, none of the sub-tasks
    in the PCTB directly assesses self-control or other forms of behavioral
    inhibition. Rather, they assess areas of physical cognition (e.g., quantity
    discrimination) or social cognition (e.g., gaze following). In three phases
    of testing, we consistently found that the strongest relation was between
    chimpanzee g scores and efficiency in the HDT. Chimpanzee g was not most
    closely related to the proportion of trials the chimpanzees chose to try to
    wait for delayed rewards, but rather most closely related to how good they
    were at waiting for those rewards when they chose to do so. We also found
    the same strong relation between HDT efficiency and those factors in the
    PCTB that loaded most strongly on chimpanzee g. These results highlight
    that, as with humans, there is a strong relation between chimpanzees’
    self-control and overall intelligence—a relation that likely reflects the
    role of successful inhibitory control during cognitive processing of
    information and intelligent decision-making.

    This volume examines the multifarious dimensions that constitute the
    workings of the Hindu temple as an architectural and urban built form.
    Eleven chapters reflect on Hindu temples from multiple standpoints tracing
    their elusive evolution from wayside shrines as well as canonization into
    classical objects; questioning the role of treatises containing their
    building rules; analyzing their prescribed proportions and orders; examining
    their presence in, and as, larger sacred habitats and ritualistic settings;
    and affirming their influential role in the contemporary Indian metropolis.
    Going beyond stereotypical presentations of Hindu temples dominated by
    chronological and stylistic themes, this study, addressed to architects,
    urbanists, and builders, combines historic scholarship, documentation,
    personal observations and fieldwork to expand the idea of the Hindu temple
    as a complex and contradictory cultural entity, that is both formal and
    informal, monumental and modest, historic and modern, and deserving of a far
    broader and deeper understanding.

    It is suggested that if archaeologists are to be successful in understanding
    the organization of past cultural systems they must understand the
    organizational relationships among places which were differentially used
    during the operation of past systems. This point is illustrated by
    observations made among the Nunamiut Eskimo. Against this background it is
    demonstrated that the two most common forms of archaeological systematics,
    “assemblage”- versus “type”-based systematics, are not appropriate for the
    study of places. In the latter case, it is not possible to analyze places as
    such, while one cannot see places with different “content” as part of a
    single system in the former. It is concluded that current archaeological
    systematics are totally inappropriate for studying past systems of
    adaptation and their evolutionary modification.

    "The flowering of Gothic architecture depended to a striking extent on the
    use of drawing as a tool of design. By drawing precise 'blueprints' with
    simple tools such as the compass and straightedge, Gothic draftsmen were
    able to develop a linearized architecture of unprecedented complexity and
    sophistication. Examination of their surviving drawings can provide valuable
    and remarkably intimate information about the Gothic design process. Gothic
    drawings include compass pricks, uninked construction lines, and other
    telltale traces of the draftsman's geometrically-based working method. This
    book offers a new perspective on Gothic architectural creativity. It shows,
    in a series of rigorous geometrical case studies, how Gothic design evolved
    over time, in two senses: in the hours of the draftsman's labor, and across
    the centuries of the late Middle Ages"--Provided by publisher

    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

    Nearly everything we treasure in the world's most beautiful cities was built
    over a century ago. Cities draw visitors because of their exquisite
    architecture, walkable neighborhoods, and human scale. Yet a great deal of
    the knowledge and practice behind successful city planning has been
    abandoned over the last hundred years--not because of traffic, population
    growth, or other practical hurdles, but because of ill-considered theories.
    An accomplished architect and urbanist goes back to the roots of what makes
    cities attractive and livable, demonstrating how we can restore function and
    beauty to our urban spaces for the long term.--

    The British scholar John Burton-Page contributed numerous formative articles
    on Indian Islamic architecture for the Encyclopaedia of Islam over a period
    of 25 years. Assembled here for the first time, these offer an insightful
    overview of the subject, ranging from the earliest mosques and tombs erected
    by the Delhi sultans in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, to the great
    monuments of the Mughal emperors dating from the 16th and 17th centuries.
    The articles cover the principal forms of Indian Islamic architecture --
    mosques, tombs, minarets, forts, gateways and water structures -- as well as
    the most important sites and their monuments. Unsurpassed for their
    compression of information, these succinct articles serve as the best
    possible introduction to the subject, indispensible for both students and
    travellers. The articles are supplemented by a portfolio of photographs
    especially selected for the volume, as well as a glossary and up to date
    bibliography.

    Questo volume si occupa di codificare il metodo per l'esecuzione di
    operazioni di lettura delle strutture edilizie che si sono costituite in
    passato a livello di "coscienza spontanea" in una progressione di grandezze
    scalari che vanno dall'edificio, all'aggregazione di edifici, all'organismo
    urbano, al territorio. L'attenzione ai prodotti architettonici del passato è
    il campo della "tipologia processuale" che è la chiave per l'utilizzazione
    della storia nell'operare come architetti nel mondo contemporaneo.

    O papel do futuro no comportamento actual dos indivíduos, em particular dos
    jovens, tem sido alvo de atenção ao longo do tempo, destacando-se aquele que
    tem vindo a ser um efeito consistente de associação entre, por um lado, a
    perspectivação e a construção de planos de futuro - expressados pelo
    conceito de perspectiva temporal de futuro (PTF) - e, por outro, a expressão
    de comportamentos adaptativos, que contribuem para uma maior adaptação ao
    meio. Dois dos contextos de estudo em que essa relação é mais abordada são
    os da educação e da saúde, este último especificamente ao nível da promoção
    de comportamentos saudáveis e da prevenção de riscos. Tendo em conta estes
    dois contextos, o presente trabalho pretende sistematizar e discutir um
    conjunto de dados, resultantes de vários estudos, e que se consideram
    relevantes para a evidenciação dessa relação.

    The informal settlements in the Global South, mostly comprising of
    inadequate building solutions, are growing rapidly, therefore calling for
    more sustainable construction interventions and upgrading strategies. Within
    this context, this study considers that appropriate construction strategies
    are capable of engaging with the local economy, affected by endemic poverty,
    therefore contributing to the improvement of the settlement's socio-economic
    and physical conditions at once. A deeper understanding of the settlements
    construction process, actors, and key factors influencing material use,
    acceptance, and distribution, is therefore needed, and is here presented for
    the case of Mathare, in Nairobi. The study is based on field-based
    qualitative and quantitative data collection through semi-structured
    interviews and mapping, and through the adoption of methods as stakeholders
    analysis and supply chain mapping. The following insights have emerged from
    the study: 1) different client groups have access to different building
    materials; 2) the distribution of materials inside the settlement is
    strictly related to stores and building sites accessibility; 3) the local
    adoption of materials is highly impacted by the availability of space both
    at the supplier store and on the building site; 4) contextual cultural
    factors can have a major role in the construction organization. as for the
    case of ethnicity influencing roles distributions in the construction
    sector. The study insights are of relevance for the practice, specifically
    to inform project managers and policymakers involved in construction
    projects in the informal settlements about local material supply and demand
    constraints. Specifically, the study highlights the need to consider the
    availability of stocking space alongside the supply as well as on-site.
    Finally, it shows the validity of adopting a mixed-methods approach, looking
    at the settlements through a socio-technical approach.

    The mathematics references in ancient China, the Zhoubi Suanjing and the
    Jiuzhang Suanshu, present information on formative ideas of ancient people
    and their perception of objects. The introduction to the Yingzao Fashi
    mentions mathematical sources, including the Zhoubi Suanjing. Both of these
    books focus on the philosophical concept of Tianyuan difang (Heaven is round
    and Earth is square), as well as inscribed and circumscribed circles. The
    square root of 2(√2), which can be derived from this part, proves to be an
    essential criterion for building, seen in Korea, China, and Japan. Using the
    exemplary Koryŏ building, the Muryangsujŏn Hall at Pusŏksa Buddhist
    Monastery, this thesis shows that the standard ground plan width of the
    outermost bay has a √2 ratio to the central bay width. Its cross-section,
    likewise, proves that √2 times or twice the distance or height (relying on
    the height of the eave columns) are applied to the distance or height
    between each column and purlin in the application of arithmetic and
    geometric concepts. In the future, this work will be a reference for the
    reconstruction design of ancient buildings prior to the Koryŏ period,
    analogous to the Muryangsujŏn Hall.

  abstract: >-
    A thorough understanding of the Shang political system is the key to any
    productive discussion of the beginning of urbanization and civilization in
    China. The earliest cities were loci of the royal lineages, which were the
    apex of the newly created class structure. The basic exploitative technology
    underwent little change from the Neolithic to the Shang, and the emergence
    of the great Shang civilization was based on a reorganized distribution of
    wealth, which enabled the concentration of society's resources in the hands
    of the ruling class. Ironically, while much of the greatest material
    achievement in Shang civilization - or perhaps any civilization - is
    wasteful in terms of human needs, in posterity such achievements honour all
    the people they represent, the ruler and the ruled. Is greatness possible
    only in such terms, or are the archaeologist's criteria for greatness
    cockeyed in the first place?

    "The award-winning First Edition of A Global History of Architecture was a
    publishing event that forever changed the way architectural history is

  abstract: >-
    Questo articolo prende in considerazione l'evidenza archeologica e
    documentaria per l'uso delle abitazioni a Roma dal 500 al 1000 d. C. Le
    fonti (il Liber Pontificialis, registri papali, iscrizioni, documenti di
    proprietà) suggeriscono che, contrariamente all'opinione comune, gli edifici
    abitativi erano diffusi quanto le molte chiese della città. È solo dal
    decimo secolo che la popolazione cominciò a diffondersi nel Campo Marzio,
    precedentemente considerato il centro dell'abitato dalle guerre gotiche in
    poi. L'evidenza archeologica suggerisce che molte tracce dell'architettura
    domestica sono state trovate, e continueranno ad essere trovate, nell'area
    monumentale centrale, a Trastevere, sull'Aventino, il Celio e le parti
    orientali della città. La precisa natura architettonica delle abitazioni è
    rappresentata da una riutilizzazione degli edifici domestici e pubblici
    romani (esempi includono la Basilica Emilia, la cosiddetta Basilica
    Argentaria, il Ludus Magnus e VAtrium Vestae). È probabile che nuove
    informazioni possano venire da un'analisi delle strutture soprawiventi
    all'interno dei monasteri medievali della città e da scavi quali quello
    attualmente in corso nel Foro di Nerva.

    This new account of international modernism explores the complex motivations
    behind this revolutionary movement and assesses its triumphs and failures.
    The work of the main architects of the movement such as Frank Lloyd Wright,
    Adolf Loos, Le Corbusier, and Mies van der Rohe is re-examined shedding new
    light on their roles as acknowledged masters. Alan Colquhoun explores the
    evolution of the movement fron Art Nouveau in the 1890s to the
    megastructures of the 1960s, revealing the often contradictory demands of
    form, function, social engagement, modernity and tradition.

  abstract: >-
    The "traditional Japanese house" is often thought of as a light, airy
    structure, built of wood, with sliding paper walls (fusuma), translucent
    paper windows (shōji), straw-matted floors (tatami), and an elaborated
    display alcove (tokonomd). This paper argues that such a building is no more
    characteristic of peasant life in early modern Japan than is the
    "traditional Japanese family." Both are creations which came into existence
    during the early modern period (1600-1868), but which only reached their
    fullest realization at the beginning of this century. This paper uses a
    variety of sources, including maps and housing surveys, to trace the
    intertwined emergence of these two forms.

    O presente estudo foi produzido em 1998 para atender, em primeiro lugar, a
    uma consulta de professores indígenas do Rio Grande do Sul. Apresenta uma
    descrição dos tipos de habitações mais comuns, atualmente, em áreas
    indígenas dos Kaingang, e ocupa-se, principalmente, de uma revisão
    bibliográfica que pretende esclarecer qual teria sido a típica habitação
    Kaingang no passado. Para tanto, trabalhamos com mais de uma dezena e meia
    de fontes diretas, além de interpretar a pesquisa arqueológica pertinente.

  abstract: >-
    We analyze the processing of cereals and its role at Early Neolithic Göbekli
    Tepe, southeastern Anatolia (10th / 9th millennium BC), a site that has
    aroused much debate in archaeological discourse. To date, only
    zooarchaeological evidence has been discussed in regard to the subsistence
    of its builders. Göbekli Tepe consists of monumental round to oval
    buildings, erected in an earlier phase, and smaller rectangular buildings,
    built around them in a partially contemporaneous and later phase. The
    monumental buildings are best known as they were in the focus of research.
    They are around 20 m in diameter and have stone pillars that are up to 5.5 m
    high and often richly decorated. The rectangular buildings are smaller
    and–in some cases–have up to 2 m high, mostly undecorated, pillars.
    Especially striking is the number of tools related to food processing,
    including grinding slabs/bowls, handstones, pestles, and mortars, which have
    not been studied before. We analyzed more than 7000 artifacts for the
    present contribution. The high frequency of artifacts is unusual for
    contemporary sites in the region. Using an integrated approach of formal,
    experimental, and macro- / microscopical use-wear analyses we show that
    Neolithic people at Göbekli Tepe have produced standardized and efficient
    grinding tools, most of which have been used for the processing of cereals.
    Additional phytolith analysis confirms the massive presence of cereals at
    the site, filling the gap left by the weakly preserved charred macro-rests.
    The organization of work and food supply has always been a central question
    of research into Göbekli Tepe, as the construction and maintenance of the
    monumental architecture would have necessitated a considerable work force.
    Contextual analyses of the distribution of the elements of the grinding kit
    on site highlight a clear link between plant food preparation and the
    rectangular buildings and indicate clear delimitations of working areas for
    food production on the terraces the structures lie on, surrounding the
    circular buildings. There is evidence for extensive plant food processing
    and archaeozoological data hint at large-scale hunting of gazelle between
    midsummer and autumn. As no large storage facilities have been identified,
    we argue for a production of food for immediate use and interpret these
    seasonal peaks in activity at the site as evidence for the organization of
    large work feasts.

    For over a century, the landscape of Angkor Wat and its surrounding area
    have been the focus of archaeological study. These studies have been
    constrained substantially, however, by a lack of chronological resolution in
    the features of the landscape and the difficulty of dating elements of the
    cultural assemblage. Recently obtained LiDAR data have transformed
    understanding of the Angkor Wat complex, enabling archaeologists to map
    terrain usually obscured by dense and protected vegetation. The results have
    informed targeted ground-based research, demonstrated previously unknown
    relationships between elements of the site, shown that the complex is much
    more extensive than previously thought and revealed a massive, unique and
    unknown structure.

    Malaysian plural society is characterized by a concentration of Chinese in
    urban and a concentration of Malays in rural areas. So far, economic and
    political factors have been emphasized to explain the spatial
    differentiation of these communities. Though the importance of these factors
    is recognized a cultural dimension is added and its impact analyzed. It is
    argued that Malays and Chinese differ in their cultural values concerning
    space. Whereas the Malay conception of space is centrifocal, the Chinese
    conception of space is bounded. The consistency of this cultural pattern is
    demonstrated by drawing examples from conceptions of geographical, social,
    religious and political space and their combination in an image of the city.
    As Malaysian towns and housing developments are built according to a Chinese
    conception of space, the absorption of Malay rural-urban migrants is impeded
    and Chinese Control over urban commercial activities is maintained. Es ist
    nicht das Bewusstsein der Menschen, das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr
    gesellschaftliches Sein, das ihr Bewusstsein bestimmt.

  abstract: >-
    The increase in global environmental problems requires more environmentally
    efficient construction. Vernacular passive strategies can play an important
    role in helping reducing energy use and CO2 emissions related to buildings.
    This paper studies the use of glazed balconies in the North of Portugal as a
    strategy to capture solar gains and reduce heat losses. The purpose is
    understanding thermal performance and comfort conditions provided by this
    passive heating strategy. The methodology includes objective (short and
    long-term monitoring), to evaluate the different parameters affecting
    thermal comfort and air quality, and subjective assessments to assess
    occupants&rsquo; perception regarding thermal sensation. The results show
    that the use of glazed balconies as a passive heating strategy in a climate
    with cold winters is viable. During the mid-seasons, the rooms with balcony
    have adequate comfort conditions. In the heating season, it is possible to
    achieve comfort conditions in sunny days while in the cooling season there
    is a risk of overheating. Regarding indoor air quality, carbon dioxide
    concentrations were low, but the average radon concentration measured was
    high when the building was unoccupied, rapidly decreasing to acceptable
    values, during occupation periods when a minimum ventilation rate was
    promoted. Occupants&rsquo; actions were essential to improving building
    behavior.

  abstract: >-
    Exilé en France en 1972, Sérgio Ferro (né en 1938) a marqué l’École
    d’architecture de Grenoble de ses enseignements et ses recherches pendant 30
    ans. Il est en particulier l’auteur de Dessin-chantier (2005, éd. de la
    Villette), ouvrage dérangeant par sa critique radicale des conditions de
    production de l’architecture en même temps que pensée originale pour une
    pratique émancipatrice du métier. L’ouvrage de Sérgio Ferro repose sur une
    trajectoire brésilienne peu connue en France et pourtant déterminante,
    initiée pendant la construction de Brasilia au sein d’un trio de jeunes
    architectes de Sao Paulo, et dont la contribution architecturale et
    théorique s’inscrit dans le Brésil des années 1960. Cette trajectoire se
    confond aussi plus largement avec celle d’une avant-garde intellectuelle et
    artistique de gauche tiraillée par les tensions entre modernité et
    sous-développement, perspectives de transformations sociales et résistance
    au régime militaire d’après 1964. L’article propose alors une « lecture
    brésilienne » du texte Dessin-chantier en retraçant le récit de cette
    trajectoire biographique d’avant l’exil et en évoquant l’héritage vivant
    dont les travaux théoriques de Ferro sur l’architecture font l’objet au
    Brésil ; ce faisant, il met en évidence la dimension fondamentalement
    politique de l’œuvre de Sérgio Ferro.

    Making Small Scale Models is for those who have never made a model before or
    want to develop or increase their skills. From cutting a straight line to
    making a scaled human figure that ''lives'', through to creating beautifully
    detailed buildings and finely detailed furniture, the book takes you through
    each stage of the process. Topics covered include methods for a wide range
    of disciplines, from theatre design to railway modelling to interior design;
    a practical guide to tools and materials; basic techniques for constructing
    scale models using simple, readily available materials; step-by-ste.

  abstract: >-
    Fu Xinian is considered by many to be the world's leading historian of
    Chinese architecture. He is an expert on every type of Chinese architecture
    from every period through the nineteenth century, and his work is at the
    cutting edge of the field. This wide-ranging book gathers together, for the
    first time in English, twelve seminal essays by Fu Xinian. It pays special
    attention to the technical aspects of the building tradition since the first
    millennium BC, and Fu Xinian's signature drawings abundantly illustrate its
    nuances. The essays delve into the modular basis for individual structures,
    complexes, and cities; lateral and longitudinal building frames; the unity
    of sculpture and building to create viewing angles; the influence of Chinese
    construction on Japanese architecture; and the reliability of images to
    inform us about architecture. Organized chronologically, the book also
    examines such topics as the representation of architecture on vessels in the
    Warring States period, early Buddhist architecture, and the evolution of
    imperial architecture from the Tang to Ming dynasty. A biography of Fu
    Xinian and a detailed Chinese-English glossary are included. Bringing
    together some of the most groundbreaking scholarship in Chinese
    architectural history, it showcases an uncontested master of the discipline.

  abstract: >-
    Les fouilles récemment menées à Lattes/Lattara (Hérault) ont permis d’ouvrir
    une nouvelle fenêtre sur les niveaux de fondation de ce comptoir lagunaire
    protohistorique, peu accessibles en raison de l’épaisseur de la séquence
    stratigraphique. Ces nouvelles données invitent à dresser un bilan de nos
    connaissances relatives à la nature de cette première occupation et du rôle
    alors joué par les Étrusques. L’ampleur du programme urbanistique conduit
    par ces derniers au début du ve s. av. J.-C. est confirmée, tout autant que
    la destruction brutale qui affecte le site vers 480/470 av. J.-C. La
    morphologie de l’îlot suggère l’existence de maisons à plusieurs pièces et
    d’un plan orthonormé rigoureux. En revanche, une séquence antérieure inédite
    a ici été mise en évidence et correspond à la phase d’installation étrusque
    à proprement parler. Une division régulière du terrain précède la
    construction d’une maison absidiale en torchis dont le plan et la métrologie
    trouvent des parallèles probants en Étrurie padane. Cette succession entre
    une division foncière, une installation provisoire et un programme de
    lotissement urbain témoigne d’une véritable entreprise planifiée, qui doit
    être mise en rapport avec le regain de la dynamique commerciale des cités
    d’Étrurie méridionale à la fin du vie-début du ve s. av. J.-C.

    This research explores the origins of observed differences in time
    preference across countries and regions. Exploiting a natural experiment
    associated with the expansion of suitable crops for cultivation in the
    course of the Columbian Exchange, the research establishes that
    pre-industrial agro-climatic characteristics which were conducive to higher
    return to agricultural investment triggered selection, adaptation, and
    learning processes that generated a persistent positive effect on the
    prevalence of long-term orientation in the contemporary era. Furthermore,
    the research establishes that these agro-climatic characteristics have had a
    culturally embodied impact on economic behavior such as technological
    adoption, education, saving, and smoking.

    Dans son premier livre dédié aux édifices modernes de Rome, publié en 1798
    en association avec Pierre Fontaine, Charles Percier s’occupe plus
    particulièrement de concevoir les seize frontispices placés au début de
    chacune des livraisons. Ces compositions de fragments architecturaux
    sculptés, inspirées notamment de Piranèse, enrichissent ce volume, consacré
    pour l’essentiel à l’architecture domestique de la Renaissance, d’une
    dimension ornementale inspirée de l’Antiquité. En même temps, par leur
    forme, ces planches imposent un type de dessin architectural différent des
    traditionnels plans, coupes, façades et perspectives, plus libres et qui
    incarne une dimension artistique de la pratique de l’architecte. Imités par
    ses disciples et plus généralement par les élèves architectes, les
    frontispices à la Percier donnent naissance à l’exercice des « éléments
    analytiques » qui s’impose à la fin du XIXe siècle comme l’une des clés de
    la formation dispensée par l’école et un marqueur de la culture Beaux-Arts.

    This paper offers a history of rammed-earth construction through the study
    of selected examples of Islamic defensive architecture in Spain. While earth
    construction differs from region to region and time to time during the
    period of Islamic domination in Spain, various examples share a number of
    common characteristics. The details of rammed-earth construction techniques
    in each historical epoch are analysed in terms of the dimensions of the
    earth boxes and their elements. The processes and the auxiliary elements of
    the formwork, and the role of putlog holes and beams are also studied. From
    this analysis a construction typology for Islamic earthworks is proposed.
    This differs from Medieval Christian rammed-earth construction which
    comprises a method using boxes and half putlogs which need a bracing system
    such as wedges, nails, ropes or Saint Andrew crosses. Finally, analysis of
    the modules and dimensions of the rammed-earth components reveals that two
    modules were used, one used during Emirate and Caliphate based on a
    dimension of a raššāší cubit (0.55 cm), the other used during the Almoravid,
    Almohad and Nasrid kingdoms based on a dimension of a ma’mūní cubit (c. 0.45
    cm)..

    Visual Culture, 1100-1800; and Jerusalem. Reflecting the many incidents of a
    long academic life, they illustrate one scholar's attempt at making order
    and sense of 1400 years of artistic growth. They deal with architecture,
    painting, objects, iconography, theories of art, aesthetics and ornament,
    and they seek to integrate our knowledge of Islamic art with Islamic culture
    and history as well as with the global concerns of the History of Art. In
    addition to the articles selected, each volume contains an introduction
    which describes, often in highly personal ways, the context in which
    Grabar's scholarship developed and the people who directed and mentored his
    efforts.  The articles in the present volume illustrate how the author's
    study of Islamic art led him in two directions for a further understanding
    of the arts. One is how to define Islamic art and what impulses provided it
    with its own peculiar forms and dynamics of growth. Was it a faith or a
    combination of social, historical, and cultural events? And how has 'Islamic
    art' impacted on the contemporary arts of the Islamic world? The other issue
    is that of the meanings to be given to forms like domes, so characteristic
    of Islamic art, or to terms like symbol, signs, or aesthetic values in the
    arts, especially when one considers the contemporary world. The Islamic
    examples allow for the development of new intellectual positions for the
    history and criticism of the arts everywhere.

    Between 10 and six thousand years ago the Arabian Peninsula saw the most
    recent of the ‘Green Arabia’ periods, when increased rainfall transformed
    this generally arid region. The transition to the Neolithic in Arabia
    occurred during this period of climatic amelioration. Various forms of stone
    structures are abundant in northern Arabia, and it has been speculated that
    some of these dated to the Neolithic, but there has been little research on
    their character and chronology. Here we report a study of 104 ‘mustatil’
    stone structures from the southern margins of the Nefud Desert in northern
    Arabia. We provide the first chronometric age estimate for this type of
    structure – a radiocarbon date of ca. 5000 BC – and describe their landscape
    positions, architecture and associated material culture and faunal remains.
    The structure we have dated is the oldest large-scale stone structure known
    from the Arabian Peninsula. The mustatil phenomenon represents a remarkable
    development of monumental architecture, as hundreds of these structures were
    built in northwest Arabia. This ‘monumental landscape’ represents one of the
    earliest large-scale forms of monumental stone structure construction
    anywhere in the world. Further research is needed to understand the function
    of these structures, but we hypothesise that they were related to rituals in
    the context of the adoption of pastoralism and resulting territoriality in
    the challenging environments of northern Arabia.

    In the past 25 years since the reconstruction of Shelter 131 of Eynan was
    suggested by Francois Valla, its image has become almost iconic—a highly
    cited symbol of early sedentism constituting a significant part of our
    knowledge on early stone constructions and the people behind them. A new
    look at the architectural remains and the stratigraphy resulted in an
    alternative reconstruction, essentially different than the one we have come
    to know. We used spatial (architectural-geometrical) analysis in order to
    study the relationships between the different architectural elements and to
    test our hypothesis that the series of postholes may have not pertained to
    the upper floor 131 of Layer IV as suggested by Perrot and Valla, but rather
    to the successive occupational and architectural episode. The association of
    the postholes with Wall 51 of Layer III sheds new light on the architectural
    remains revealing their geometric design, an important characteristic of
    Early Natufian Architecture, the meaning and implications of which we
    shortly discuss.

    The site of Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey keeps fascinating
    archaeologists as it is being exposed. The excavation since 1995 has been
    accompanied by a lively discussion about the meaning and implications of its
    remarkable early Neolithic megalithic architecture, unprecedented in its
    monumentality, complexity and symbolic content. The building history and the
    chronological relations between the different structures (enclosures),
    however, remain in many ways a challenge and open to further analysis. The
    study presented here is an attempt to contribute in this direction by
    applying a preliminary architectural formal analysis in order to reconstruct
    aspects of the architectural design processes involved in the construction
    of the monumental enclosures. This is done under the premise that such
    investigation would shed light on the chaîne opératoire of the enclosures'
    construction and their history, thus enabling a fresh look as well as an
    evaluation of past suggestions regarding these structures and the people who
    built them. Indeed, the results of the analysis brought to light an
    underlying geometric pattern which offers a new understanding of the
    assemblage of architectural remains indicating that three of the stone-built
    large enclosures were planned and initially built as a single project.

    "Embracing a thousand years of history and an area stretching from the
    Atlantic to the borders of India and China, Robert Hillenbrand - a world
    authority on Islamic art and architecture - has written an unrivalled new
    synthesis of the arts of Islamic civilization. From the death of the Prophet
    Muhammad to the survival of the Ottoman empire well into the modern age,
    Hillenbrand traces the evolution of an extraordinary range of art forms,
    including architecture, calligraphy, book illumination, painting, ceramics,
    glassware, textiles and metalwork. Complete with maps and glossary, this is
    an accessible and definitive guide to the arts of a vastly accomplished

    This paper addresses itself to the question of how and why different
    societies produce different spatial orders through building forms and
    settlement patterns. It consists of three parts. Firstly, at a
    metatheoretical level, it is suggested that spatial organization should be
    seen as a member of a family of ‘morphic languages’ which are unlike both
    natural and mathematical languages but which borrow properties from each. In
    general, morphic languages are used to constitute rather than represent the
    social through their syntax (that is the systematic production of pattern).
    Secondly, a general syntactic theory of space organization is proposed. It
    is argued that spatial patterns in both complex buildings and settlements
    fall into eight major types, which are interrelated in structural ways.
    Finally, the syntactic theory is used to integrate a number of recent
    general propositions made in anthropology regarding human space
    organization.

  abstract: >-
    Stratified societies in southern Africa first developed in the
    Shashe–Limpopo Basin. As is well known, rank-based society at K2 developed
    into class distinction at Mapungubwe. The transfer of this new social
    organisation to Great Zimbabwe has received less attention. New research on
    rainmaking practices suggests that a Mapungubwe dynasty introduced class
    structures at Great Zimbabwe. Poor climatic conditions at the end of the
    13th century undermined sacred leaders at Mapungubwe itself, and while
    vulnerable, the elite at Great Zimbabwe took over the important gold and
    ivory trade. Among other things, the new elite used the unique Zimbabwe
    birdstones to establish their legitimacy.

    "Starting with the dawn of human society, through early civilizations, to
    the pre-Columbian American tribes, Architecture of First Societies: A Global
    Perspective traces the different cultural formations that developed in
    various places throughout the world to form the built environment. Looking
    through the lens of both time and geography, the history of early
    architecture is brought to life with full-color photographs, maps, and
    drawings. Drawing on the latest research in archaeological and
    anthropological knowledge, this landmark book also looks at how indigenous
    societies build today in order to help inform the past." -- Publisher

  abstract: >-
    Many archaeologists investigated the burial practices of the Jomon in order
    to clarify emerging social complexity, especially in the 1950s. Recently,
    since the social complexity of the Jomon became an important issue, burial
    practice has been recognised as an indicator of a hereditary ranking system.
    As I have noted elsewhere, there is no clear evidence that a hereditary
    ranking system existed in Jomon society. However, instead of searching for
    hereditary ranking in the Jomon, burial practices could be analysed from
    another aspect. The temporal and regional distribution of Jomon burial
    practices has been clarified. In the Kanto district, communal graves
    appeared in the early Late Jomon. This type of burial has been discovered
    only in this area. In the same period, some burial practices also appeared
    in other areas of Eastern Japan. Although this change from Middle to Late
    Jomon has been recognised, it has not been investigated from the perspective
    of social complexity. In this paper, I will try to examine the change in
    burial practices from the Middle to the Late Jomon in terms of social
    complexity.

    This chapter provides a preliminary reflection of the concept of sustainable

    is not a new concept as popularized by the Brundtland Report published in
    1987. It traces back its original source from the traditional agricultural
    practices among the ancient tribes in Sri Lanka, Eastern Africa; and in the
    American and European continents some of which may date back to as far as
    2000 years ago. It also provides the structure of the book, serving as a
    guide to the prospective readers.

  abstract: >-
    Ten years in the making, A History of Architecture ranges from the first
    prehistoric environments on record to the most recent examples of urban
    design. A landmark work of impressive scope, the book is enhanced by 700
    halftone illustrations and 150 drawings especially prepared by architect
    Richard Tobias. Kostof's range of study includes not only the monumental
    religious, governmental and upper-class structures around which
    architectural history has usually been written but also the diversity of
    ordinary domestic, rural, and urban buildings, and landscapes which surround
    them. Moreover, Kostof evaluates Western achievement in the context of
    contemporary cultures elsewhere. Thus he discusses the high points of
    imperial Rome along with Buddhist stupas and Han palaces, compares medieval
    Florence with medieval Cairo, and introduces Inca and Aztec cities as the
    Spanish conquistadores would have seen them. The author's premise is that
    buldings are conditioned by the social, economic, and political frame of
    their time; in this sense, Kostof concludes, the history of architecture can
    be considered an aspect of the history of human institutions. "Architecture,
    in the end," he writes, "is nothing less than the gift of making places for
    some human purpose."

  abstract: >-
    Despite many publications, a synoptical and instrumental knowledge (or
    theory) of architectural aesthetics, proportions and other objective and
    systemic parameters of aesthetics is still in its infancy. The knowledge on
    the Golden Section is best developed, while other aspects and their
    integration into an organized theory and system of categories are still
    widely missing. This paper introduces results of independent research over
    30 years. The study focusses on proportions of domestic architecture and a
    multidisciplinary approach to proportion & perception.

    L'identification des saisons d'occupation des sites archéologiques reste un
    problème majeur pour les archéologues, et l'un des points essentiels de
    l'étude des changements des stratégies d'acquisition des ressources de
    chasseurs-cueilleurs. L'application de l'analyse des dépôts cémenteux à
    l'interprétation de l'occupation saisonnière des sites est présentée ici.
    L'exemple ďHayonim montre que les chasseurs-cueilleurs du natoufien ont
    occupé le site durant toute l'année, contrairement à leurs prédécesseurs
    qui, durant le Kébarien, ne semblent l'avoir utilisé qu'entre les mois de
    novembre et de février. L'apport de ces données est discuté dans le cadre
    des origines de la sédentarisation préagricole qui s'est produite au Levant
    à la fin du natoufien.

    Abstract
                Self-control underlies cognitive abilities such as decision making and future planning. Delay of gratification is a measure of self-control and involves obtaining a more valuable outcome in the future by tolerating a delay or investing a greater effort in the present. Contextual issues, such as reward visibility and type, may influence delayed gratification performance, although there has been limited comparative investigation between humans and other animals, particularly non-primate species. Here, we adapted an automated ‘rotating tray’ paradigm used previously with capuchin monkeys to test for delay of gratification ability that requires little pre-test training, where the subject must forgo an immediate, less preferred reward for a delayed, more preferred one. We tested New Caledonian crows and 3–5-year-old human children. We manipulated reward types to differ in quality or quantity (Experiments 1 and 2) as well as visibility (Experiment 2). In Experiments 1 and 2, both species performed better when the rewards varied in quality as opposed to quantity, though performed above chance in both conditions. In Experiment 1, both crows and children were able to delay gratification when both rewards were visible. In Experiment 2, 5-year-old children outperformed 3- and 4-year olds, though overall children still performed well, while the crows struggled when reward visibility was manipulated, a result which may relate to difficulties in tracking the experimenters’ hands during baiting. We discuss these findings in relation to the role of contextual issues on self-control when making species comparisons and investigating the mechanisms of self-control.

    Based on a lifelong professional and personal interest, "Traditional
    Buildings" presents a unique survey of vernacular architecture across the
    globe. The reader is taken on a fascinating tour of traditional building
    around the world, which includes the loess cave homes of central China, the
    stilt houses on the shores of Dahomey, the housebarns of Europe and North
    America, the wind towers of Iran, the Bohio houses of the Arawak Indians of
    the Caribbean, and much more. Professor's Noble's extensive travels have
    allowed him to examine many of the building at close quarters and the richly
    illustrated text includes photographs from his personal collection. With its
    comprehensive and detailed bibliography, the work will be welcomed by
    experts and non-specialists alike.

    The ongoing debate among practitioners and in academia about the meaning and
    understanding of Islamic architecture will be energized by this book. It
    contains essays by architects and academics from various parts of the world
    which clarify how the carious disciplines of the design profession can be
    employed to build in the spirit of Islam. Divided into three sections the
    book covers: *meaning from Faith, which draws meaning from the Islamic faith
    in order to propose a built environment that is universally
    beneficial*analysis of History, which examines historical buildings and
    planning concepts, and suggest how to apply lessons learned to contemporary
    practice*contemporary Trends, which discusses current trends in
    architecture, education and socio-economic aspects of various Muslim
    countries. Illustrated throughout, this book will appeal to students and
    scholars, practising architects and planners alike.

  abstract: >-
    Even after more than 250 years since its discovery, Pompeii continues to
    resonate powerfully in both academic discourse and the popular imagination.
    This volume brings together a collection of ten papers that advance,
    challenge and revise the present conceptions of the city's art, industry and
    infrastructure. The discussions of domestic art in this book, a perennial
    topic for Pompeian scholars, engage previously neglected subjects such as
    wall ornaments in domestic decoration, the sculpture collection in the house
    of Octavius Quartio, and the role of the covered walkways in luxury villa
    architecture. The famous cupid's frieze from the house of the Vettii is
    given a novel and intelligent reinterpretation. The place of industry at
    Pompeii, in both the physical and economic landscapes has long been
    overlooked. The chapters on building practice in inhabited houses, on the
    presence of fulling workshops in atrium houses, and on the urban pottery
    industry serve as successful contributions to a more complete understanding
    of the life of the ancient city. Finally, this volume breaks new ground in
    the consideration of the urban infrastructure of Pompeii, a topic that has
    won serious attention only in the last decades, but one that is playing an
    increasingly central role in Pompeian studies. The final three chapters
    offer a reassessment of the Pompeian street network, a scientific analysis
    of the amount of lead in Pompeian drinking water, and a thorough analysis of
    the water infrastructure around the forum that supported its architectural
    transformation in the last decades before the eruption of mount Vesuvius in
    AD 79.

    In the last century the exploitation of carbonate rocks for the lime´s
    handmade manufacture has disappeared in most cases of our territory. In fact
    it is more difficult to find testimonies of this practice. It is the case of
    the Spanish village of Ituero y Lama located in the province of Segovia, and
    where the production of lime began before the middle of the XX century.
    Nowadays only are conserved the remains of some abandoned ovens used in the
    process. This article is the consequence of an interview carried out to Mr.
    Rubio, who worked in the lime ovens since his childhood, and whose testimony
    is very important to understand how the derived processes of that kind of
    mining was, and also its anthropological dimension.

  abstract: >-
    Intensive but localized cultivation of cereal crops on alluvial wetlands is
    thought to have provided the ecological basis for the primary Neolithic
    settlement that spread across southwest Asia and southeast Europe. New
    excavations at Çatalhöyük provide an opportunity to test this horticultural
    model via multiple data sources. Geoarchaeological studies show that the
    main Neolithic occupation coincided with a period of active river
    alluviation. Most of the area surrounding Çatalhöyük was therefore under
    floodwaters each spring that would have seriously damaged any autumn‐sown
    cereal crops. Independent evidence that the cereal crops consumed at
    Çatalhöyük were grown under rain‐fed conditions derives from the paucity of
    silicified multicellular wheat phytoliths at the site. Together, these and
    other data suggest that the bulk of the cereal agriculture was not carried
    out in the immediate vicinity of Çatalhöyük but was at least 13 km and 3 h
    away in dryland soils. In turn, this implies that there may have been
    seasonal fission and fusion of Çatalhöyük’s population, with systematic
    exploitation of, and impact on, a range of different ecological zones. This
    phase of nucleated settlement ended when river flooding ceased, coincident
    with a multidecadal drought from 6300 to 6140 BC.

    When classical elastic analysis fails to model correctly the structural
    behavior of historical masonry structures because of the brittle, rigid,
    anisotropic, and inhomogeneous characteristics of their building material,
    equilibrium-based limit state analysis constitutes an efficient alternative
    for their structural assessment. The lack of knowledge about the history of
    loading makes the actual state of stresses impossible to determine for these
    statically indeterminate structures. However, Plastic Theory provides a
    powerful theoretical framework that defines in a rather simple way the
    structural safety level. The lower-bound theorem of plasticity can be
    applied using graphic statics because it ensures that equilibrium and yield
    conditions are respected when applying specific constraints to the nodes of
    the reciprocal diagrams.This article focuses on limit stat analysis of
    statically indeterminate structures by means of geometrical considerations
    using graphic statics reciprocal diagrams. For linear-bended structures, we
    show that: (1) the conditions of stability can be defined graphically by
    constructing safety domains; (2) collapse modes can be identified and
    related to specific reciprocal polygons; and (3) the exact value of the
    collapse load factor can be deduced graphically from the diagrams. Finally,
    we extend these results to plane masonry arches in relation with the
    classical thrust line approach.

    The history of mudbrick production and construction in the southern Levant
    may be dated as far back to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. However, at many of
    the sites where mudbrick remains were noted, their preservation was poor, so
    investigation of their production and the related construction techniques in
    antiquity was precluded. The 7,200 year old (cal BP) site of Tel Tsaf,
    located in the Jordan Valley, is distinguished by outstanding preservation
    of mudbrick architecture, which enables us to delve into various issues
    related to mudbrick technology, construction and preservation. The present
    paper discusses some of the mudbrick features at Tel Tsaf and their
    characteristics and offers a comprehensive analytical study of the mudbricks
    from multiple contexts and phases. These demonstrate consistency in three of
    the four measured variables: magnetic susceptibility, organic content and
    calcium carbonate equivalent. The results of our study suggest that while we
    can identify morphometric variability between bricks and walls, by and
    large, a uniform composition characterized the tested assemblages without
    any temporal or spatial variability. This indicates that a single
    locally-sourced raw material was used and that recycling of old decayed
    mudbricks was likely practiced. The consistency of mudbrick-production
    during all phases of the occupation at Tel Tsaf and the absence of multiple
    recipes implies that a shared production and technological know-how was
    maintained for at least 500 years at the site.

    Anne Roth Congès, L'hypothèse d'une basilique à deux nefs à Conimbriga et
    les transformations du forum, p. 711-751. Le monument qui ferme au nord le
    forum augustéen de Conimbriga, bâti sur un cryptoportique à deux nefs et
    pourvu sur son long côté d'une annexe carrée, a été interprété comme un
    temple précoce du culte impéprial, mais la restitution proposée est
    discutable et constitue un unicum. On trouve cependant pour le plan de
    l'édifice de bonnes comparaisons dans les basiliques contemporaines, dont
    certaines n'ont que deux nefs (Zuglio, Vidy, premières basiliques de Glanum,
    Valeria, Nyon), et dont beaucoup, à nef unique ou à nef centrale et
    déambulatoire, possèdent en annexe axiale une aedes Augusti. Or de nombreux
    indices sur le terrain et l'étude métrologique des vestiges montrent que la
    basilique à trois nefs située sur le long côté est du forum, considérée
    jusqu'ici comme augus- (v. au verso) téenne, est en réalité plus tardive et
    ne fait donc pas double emploi avec la basilique à deux nefs. En définitive,
    ce sont trois états et non deux qu'il faut reconnaître sur le forum de
    Conimbriga : un état augustéen avec basilique à deux nefs et aedes Augusti,
    et boutiques ; un état probablement flavien avec temple du culte impérial et
    son péribole, basilique à trois nefs et boutiques; un état tardif au cours
    duquel, basilique et boutiques étant détruites, une restauration maladroite
    les remplace par un portique en π, définissant avec le péribole du temple
    une area sacra close qui n'est sans doute plus un forum.

    Desde sua primeira edição inglesa em 1993, Entender a arquitetura tem se
    transformado em um texto de referência clássico. Este manual ilustrado
    continua sendo o único texto de seu gênero que examina a arquitetura como um
    fenômeno cultural, artístico e tecnológico por meio de um enfoque duplo: o
    temático, que aborda os elementos de arquitetura, e o histórico, que se
    centra em sua evolução temporal e seu significado. Seu texto completo,
    acessível e agradável, de caráter claro e básico, destaca-se pela seleção
    criteriosa de exemplos e por comparações perspicazes, resultando em um
    manual de altíssimo valor didático e adequado para uma introdução à
    complexidade de conceitos e orientações fundamentais ao entendimento da
    história da arquitetura.

    The current conception of the art of the abbey of Cluny and of what is
    generally known as the Cluniac Order has been formed to an inordinate degree
    on the basis of one historical document, Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia ad
    Guillelmum. Indeed, many scholars have seen the treatise's passage on art
    (Apol 28-29) as a description of art as it existed at Cluny at the time of
    the writing of the Apologia (probably 1125). In confronting the question,
    this article briefly takes up a number of issues, including the belief that
    the Apologia was specifically addressed to the abbey of Cluny, that Bernard
    was either strongly repulsed by or strongly attracted to art, and that Apol
    29 is a description of actual cloister sculpture, most notably that of the
    cloister of Pons at Cluny. Instead, the passage which has been seen as a
    description of the cloister of Pons is explained as a critique of certain
    elements of art as a spiritual distraction--the implication being that a
    reformulation of our artistic conception of Cluny is long overdue, and that
    the criticism of art contained in the Apologia played a larger role than
    that of merely acting as a censure of artworks as they existed at Cluny.

    Abbot Suger's art program at St-Denis has long been credited with the
    reintroduction of "allegory" into Western art after centuries of disuse. A
    new understanding of that reintroduction is caught up in a web of previously
    unrecognized issues: that inventing the exegetical stained-glass window
    acted as a justification of the monastic use of art, that this claim was
    contradicted by new thought on art and the senses, that this new art
    appeared first not at St-Denis but elsewhere, and that the construction of a
    new elite art for the literate layperson emerged from all this.

    Islam is seen by many scholars as an urban religion, which favours communal
    practice on individual worship. Although, piety is the only source of
    appraisal, it is widely accepted that most of Islam's teaching is best
    practised in an urban setting. It is not surprising that Islam made
    particular emphasis on the form and design of the city enabling it a greater
    functionality and responsiveness to meet the socio-economic and cultural
    needs of the community. This article presents an analysis of the spatial and
    functional arrangements of the Islamic city and assesses their
    socio-cultural meanings.

  abstract: >-
    The vault over the crossing at Pisa cathedral is elliptical in plan and has
    an exposed exterior profile. These characteristics, unique in 11th-century
    Tuscany, have caused scholars to doubt that the dome could have been built
    as part of the original cathedral fabric, which was largely complete by
    1118. Yet Sanpaolesi's recent discussion of the problem, based on his study
    of the cupola during its restoration in 1957, presents substantial evidence
    in support of an early date (1090-1100) for the squinches and tambour below
    the cupola proper, and he argues convincingly that the cupola itself must
    share this date. Acceptance of his conclusions, however, does not
    necessitate assuming that the cupola was foreseen when the cathedral was
    planned in 1063, or that its original appearance conformed to what we see
    today. Indeed, I will argue that the unusual shape of the cupola is the
    inevitable consequence of a decision to vault the crossing, taken after the
    foundations of the cathedral were already laid. Further, I will present
    evidence which suggests that the exterior profile of the dome was not
    exposed originally, and has only been exposed since the late 14th century.
    Finally, I will show that in its original form the cupola was closely
    related to contemporary Lombard structures.

    The structure of buildings from the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) in China has
    heretofore been studied alternatively as the culmination of earlier periods
    of architectural styles from about the 10th century and as the beginning of
    a new phase in Chinese construction that lasts until the beginning of the
    Modern period in the 19th century. This article takes as its focus halls
    built at palatial or religious complexes in north China during the Yuan
    period to determine if a period style can be defined within the homogeneous
    timber frame building tradition. Studying the buildings and their details
    through surviving architecture and fragments, contemporary descriptions, and
    contemporary painting, the investigation concludes that, although the Yuan
    period may be termed transitional, its buildings are more closely allied
    with the pre-Yuan than the post-Yuan period, especially as the earlier style
    is known from the illustrated construction manual Yingzao Fashi.

    The modern study of Chinese architecture was initiated in the 1930s by
    Western-trained Chinese architects, in particular, Liang Sicheng. Even
    today, his writings dominate the field. This examination of the effects of a
    single powerful voice on the study of China's architecture of the Tang
    dynasty (618-907) demonstrates that Chinese architectural history was
    intertwined with the life and agenda of Liang Sicheng and was reflective of
    Chinese politics of the tumultuous decades of the 1930s through the 1970s.
    As a result, Chinese architecture as we know and understand it has become a
    selective, even exclusionary set of buildings.

    Throughout history, China has maintained one of the world's richest built
    civilizations. The nation's architectural achievements range from its
    earliest walled cities and the First Emperor's vision of city and empire, to
    bridges, pagodas, and the twentieth-century constructions of the Socialist
    state. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt
    presents the first fully comprehensive survey of Chinese architecture in any
    language. With rich political and historical context, Steinhardt covers
    forty centuries of architecture, from the genesis of Chinese building
    through to the twenty-first century and the challenges of urban expansion
    and globalism. Steinhardt follows the extraordinary breadth of China's
    architectural legacy--including excavation sites, gardens, guild halls, and
    relief sculpture--and considers the influence of Chinese architecture on
    Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet. Architectural examples from Chinese
    ethnic populations and various religions are examined, such as monasteries,
    mosques, observatories, and tombs. Steinhardt also shows that Chinese
    architecture is united by a standardized system of construction, applicable
    whether buildings are temples, imperial palaces, or shrines. Every
    architectural type is based on the models that came before it, and
    principles established centuries earlier dictate building practices. China's
    unique system has allowed its built environment to stand as a profound
    symbol of Chinese culture

  abstract: >-
    Human beings of all cultures build some form of shelter, and the global
    distribution of Homo sapiens depends on this basic trait. All great apes
    (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan) build analogous structures
    (called nests or beds) at least once a day throughout their adult lives,
    which suggests that this elementary technology was present before the
    hominid lines separated. This thesis investigates the variability and
    function of specifically wild chimpanzee shelters. 

    I compared characteristics of chimpanzee nests, nesting trees, nest shape,
    and architecture in two savanna-dwelling populations on opposite sides of
    Africa: Fongoli, Senegal, and Issa, Tanzania. Savanna habitats are the most
    extreme habitats in which chimpanzees survive today, and may represent a
    similar environment to that in which early hominins evolved in the
    Plio-Pleistocene (Chapter 2). Investigating variation in nest-building
    within and between these two extreme habitats made it possible to tackle
    hypotheses of the shelter function of nests (Chapter 3). 

    The influence of environment, specifically the role of protection from
    disease vectors and fluctuating temperatures, was assessed through a novel
    experiment in which I slept overnight in arboreal chimpanzee nests and on
    the bare earth (Chapter 4). To assess whether or not nests serve as an
    anti-predation function, I compared nesting in Issa, where predators are
    abundant, to Fongoli, where they are absent (Chapter 5). I provided further
    support for the thermoregulatory function of nests by showing that
    chimpanzees build more insulating nests in adverse weather conditions
    (Chapter 6). 

    Nest-building is a learned behaviour, but its ontogeny is little known. I
    investigated social sources of variation in nest building in Fongoli to
    examine whether sex and age differences exist in nest building duration,
    nest position, shape and architecture (Chapter 7). 

    Finally, ecosystem engineering is a consequence of animal construction, from
    ants to humans. I investigated use-wear traces around nests to assess niche
    construction of nest- building. I showed that chimpanzees repeatedly re-used
    these specific nest-spots within trees, which are pre-fabricated for future
    building through repeated pruning and shaping of these structures (Chapter
    8). 

    Nest building in great apes may be the foundation of constructivity in
    hominids. This thesis describes proximate functions and influences on
    nest-building variation in wild chimpanzees that help to model the evolution
    of shelter in hominids.

    As an important structural member in Chinese timber structure system,
    Dougong has an excellent capability in earthquake resistance. Through low
    cyclic loading experiment of single Dougong, two Dougongs and four Dougongs,
    the degrading rule of lateral stiffness of Dougong was studied. According to
    that, the hysteresis curve and skeleton curve of force –displacement were
    researched and the formula of resilience model and mechanical model were
    established. The experiment data show that slippage is the main deformation
    of Dougong. Energy dissipation due to frictional slippage is an important
    reason for the excellent seismic behavior of ancient wooden structure. The
    shape of hysteretic loops of Dougong assumes to be parallelogram. Plump area
    of hysteretic loop accounts for its excellent energy dissipation
    performance. The mechanic model of Dougong belongs to linear strengthen
    elastic-plastic model. Both the fitting equation of force-displacement and
    resilience model reflect stiffness changes of Dougong. These basic theories
    provide a theoretical basis for the study on the seismic performance, repair
    and strengthening of ancient wooden structures.

    With few exceptions, prior to the year 1200, square-planned vaults of
    sexpartite figuration were used in the high bays of larger Gothic churches.
    After 1200, in the original construction of all High Gothic churches, only
    rectangular-planned, quadripartite vaults were used. Previous explanations
    for this phenomenon have focused primarily on the stylistic implications of
    the change in vault configuration, while others have pointed to certain
    constructional differences. Yet none of these adequately explain the sudden
    shift. This paper, based on an analysis of the structural forces developed
    during high vault construction, offers a new theory that clearly points to
    the reason for the obsolescence of the sexpartite systems for the later
    buildings.

    Many scholars have speculated on the shape of the first great dome on
    Justinian's Hagia Sophia, which was demolished in 558 after a partial
    collapse the year before. Rowland Mainstone has suggested that it was a
    shallow structure, anchored directly to the upper cornice at the culmination
    of the pendentives. His basis for assuming this profile is John Malalas's
    testimony that the new dome was constructed 20 feet higher than the first
    dome, which would thereby have been a full two-fifths shallower than its
    replacement. By accepting Malalas's testimony almost too eagerly, modern
    scholars subvert the eyewitness account in Procopius's The Buildings, which
    makes clear reference to a "rounded structure" resting on the main arches
    and standing below the dome itself. Such a structure, which according to
    Procopius contain the dome's windows, can only be interpreted as a drum.
    Procopius refers in almost identical terms to the central dome of the Church
    of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, taking pains to draw a parallel here
    with the drum of Hagia Sophia. Both churches, he attests, have this same
    "circular structure" resting upon the arches and penetrated by the windows.
    A later literary source confirms that the Holy Apostles did indeed have
    drums under its five domes, and most prominently under the central dome. If
    St. Sophia's drum accommodated the full height of the windows, and provided
    sufficient headroom for persons walking upon the cornice, it might well have
    been ten feet high or more. Malalas's 20-foot differential, if it is
    reliable in the first place, is not violated by this hypothesis; for it
    could refer simply to the relative depths of the first and second domes,
    while ignoring the lesser change in elevation implied by raising the first,
    shallower dome on a drum.

    North-western Arabia is marked by thousands of prehistoric stone structures.
    Of these, the monumental, rectilinear type known as mustatils has received
    only limited attention. Recent fieldwork in AlUla and Khaybar Counties,
    Saudi Arabia, demonstrates that these monuments are architecturally more
    complex than previously supposed, featuring chambers, entranceways and
    orthostats. These structures can now be interpreted as ritual installations
    dating back to the late sixth millennium BC, with recent excavations
    revealing the earliest evidence for a cattle cult in the Arabian Peninsula.
    As such, mustatils are amongst the earliest stone monuments in Arabia and
    globally one of the oldest monumental building traditions yet identified.

    Construction of the Cathedral or Duomo of S. Maria del Fiore began in
    Florence in 1293/94, reached the stage of rising masonry by 1296, and had
    progressed so well by 1300 that the Florentine city council authorized a
    lifetime tax exemption for its founding architect, Arnolfo di Cambio. But at
    some moment after this auspicious start ill-fortune intervened: by 1310
    Arnolfo was dead and work on his project suspended. Refounded as a new
    project in a series of committee decisions in the years 1357-1368, Florence
    Cathedral is generally regarded as anonymous or collective in authorship.
    Its fame rests not on Arnolfo's abandoned and unrecorded project but on the
    prodigious cupola erected by Filippo Brunelleschi from 1420 to 1436,
    Europe's first major dome since antiquity and chief harbinger of the Italian
    Renaissance. In 1978 the author presented excavation results that questioned
    the Brunelleschi-centered tradition and reinforced instead a persistent
    counter-tradition which attributes the basic features of the 1368 plan and
    of Brunelleschi's cupola to Arnolfo's original project of ca. 1293-1296.
    That preliminary hypothesis in favor of Arnolfo as conceptual author of
    Florence Cathedral is now strengthened by the results of a second Duomo
    excavation in 1980. The new findings, together with a reappraisal of the
    documentary evidence and a set of reconstruction drawings, are submitted
    here as a second and longer look at the project that changed the course of
    European architecture.

    Architecture is the only visual art that cannot be executed by the
    form-giver alone: it invariably demands the assistance of other executants.
    The contemporary architect goes one step further and executes buildings
    entirely by remote control. The beginnings of architecture by remote control
    are usually linked to the development of the working drawing in the
    Renaissance. This paper examines the drawing and text of a Sienese building
    contract of 1340, and concludes that execution by remote control was already
    a significant part of the culture of Gothic architects.

    When it becomes clear that a given interpretative model (or set of criteria)
    contains irreducible contradictions and is incapable of resolving certain
    stubborn problems, it is time for a new paradigm. Recognizing that
    scholarship on Gothic architecture has long since reached this impasse, this
    study identifies new terms of understanding in the oppositional pair
    "modernism" and "historicism." These two transhistorical concepts are found
    to offer numerous interpretative advantages over such traditional categories
    as "skeletal form," "diaphaneity," "linearity," "diagonality," "square
    schematism," and the like, all of which are severely burdened by the well
    known constrictive problematics of "style," among other difficulties.
    Properly defined and understood, the modernism/historicism paradigm is shown
    to offer numerous advantages in studying medieval architecture across a wide
    range of concerns, from descriptive, componential, and formal analysis to
    social, intellectual, and contextual integration. The entire apparatus of
    the great cathedrals is seen in a radically new, comprehensive way, and such
    intractable historical problems as that of the seemingly oxymoronic "Gothic
    column" are resolved. The proposed paradigm is further explored and tested
    regarding both word and image in medieval architecture, in a new reading of
    the controversial texts of Abbot Suger on Saint-Denis, and in a revised
    solution to the Bourges "problem."

    Since Alberti, and most critically since Wittkower’s Architectural
    Principles, architectural theory has tended to construe ‘proportions’ in
    plenary, static terms. The dimension of time and change that relentlessly
    affects all human endeavor is not accommodated by the celebrated Albertian
    ideal of immutable design perfection, so perfect in all respects that once
    attained ‘nothing can be added, taken away, or altered, but for the worse’.
    This article, drawing on the author’s recent book, Building-in-Time from
    Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (Yale, 2010), outlines the
    antithetical, dynamic proportional methodology of the pre-Albertian
    architectural regime. Its point of departure was the author’s concept of
    durational aesthetics, according to which perfected architectural form is
    produced by a process of incessant revision. What distinguished this process
    from related ancient or neo-antique doctrines was above all its dynamic
    modality and participation in the fluid orientation and processes of
    ‘building-in-time’.

    The residential mobility patterns of modern hunter-gatherers broadly reflect
    local resource availability, but the proximate ecological and social forces
    that determine the timing of camp movements are poorly known. We tested the
    hypothesis that the timing of such moves maximizes foraging efficiency as
    hunter-gatherers move across the landscape. The marginal value theorem
    predicts when a group should depart a camp and its associated foraging area
    and move to another based on declining marginal return rates. This
    influential model has yet to be directly applied in a population of
    hunter-gatherers, primarily because the shape of gain curves (cumulative
    resource acquisition through time) and travel times between patches have
    been difficult to estimate in ethnographic settings. We tested the
    predictions of the marginal value theorem in the context of hunter-gatherer
    residential mobility using historical foraging data from nomadic, socially
    egalitarian Batek hunter-gatherers (n = 93 d across 11 residential camps)
    living in the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. We characterized
    the gain functions for all resources acquired by the Batek at daily
    timescales and examined how patterns of individual foraging related to the
    emergent property of residential movements. Patterns of camp residence times
    conformed well with the predictions of the marginal value theorem,
    indicating that communal perceptions of resource depletion are closely
    linked to collective movement decisions. Despite (and perhaps because of) a
    protracted process of deliberation and argument about when to depart camps,
    Batek residential mobility seems to maximize group-level foraging
    efficiency.

  abstract: >-
    The Orders, the long-time emblematic centerpiece of architectural education,
    were banished from studio in the United States a half-century ago. They were
    exiled to the curriculum's sparse offerings in history when the Bauhaus
    system of education in architecture displaced the Beaux Arts system. The
    Orders stand for an entire system of design based on recognizable building
    components, proportionality, and coherence. Their presence would improve the
    formal qualities of designs across the entire spectrum from buildings
    addressing the increased interest in traditional qualities in buildings to
    those pushing forward the legacy of Modernism's founders, men who themselves
    knew the Orders well.
