  abstract = {Among the nearly seventy drawings on parchment preserved from the model book of Villard de Honnecourt are a number done in the "chantier" of Reims Cathedral, around 1230. They are of great interest, not only as a record of the building of the Cathedral, but for what they show of the graphic representation of architecture in the late Middle Ages. They include the first drawing combining the interior and exterior elevation, the first cross-section, and an idiosyncratic representation of the central absidal chapel. While Villard does not seem to have been an architect or master mason, his volume documents a highly developed graphic capacity. The paper is a critical study of the group.},

The construction process incorporates not only the usual elements of planning, materials procurement, and installation, but also integrates some thirty Shinto rituals that mark important milestones in the construction process. This renewal is remarkable because it preserves an ancient architectural style that is extremely susceptible to decay as well as the ancient construction technologies needed to build it. Because each cycle is very closely modeled on its predecessor, the most recent reconstruction, completed in 1993, provides a window through which we can examine ancient construction attitudes and technologies.},

  abstract = {Current teaching methods for architectural history seldom embrace building technology as an essential component of study. Accepting the premise that architectural history is a fundamental component to the overall architectural learning environment, it is argued that the study of construction history will further enhance student knowledge. This hypothesis created an opportunity to investigate how the study of construction history could be incorporated to strengthen present teaching methods. Strategies for teaching architectural history were analyzed with the determination that an incorporation of educational instructional design applications using object-oriented programming and hypermedia provided the optimal solution. This evaluation led to the development of the HISTCON interactive, multimedia educational computer program. Used initially to teach 19th Century iron and steel construction history, the composition of the program provides the mechanism to test the significance of construction history in the study of architectural history. Future development of the program will provide a method to illustrate construction history throughout the history of architecture. The study of architectural history, using a construction oriented methodology, is shown to be positively correlated to increased understanding of architectural components relevant to architectural history and building construction.},

  abstract = {For humans, there appears to be a clear link between general intelligence and self-control behavior, such as sustained delay of gratification [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Chimpanzees also delay gratification [10, 11, 12] and can be given tests of general intelligence (g) [13, 14, 15], but these two constructs have never been compared within the same sample of nonhuman animals. We presented 40 chimpanzees with the hybrid delay task (HDT) [16, 17], which measures inter-temporal choices and the capacity for sustained delay of gratification, and the primate cognitive test battery (PCTB), which measures g in chimpanzees [13, 14, 15]. Importantly, none of the sub-tasks in the PCTB directly assesses self-control or other forms of behavioral inhibition. Rather, they assess areas of physical cognition (e.g., quantity discrimination) or social cognition (e.g., gaze following). In three phases of testing, we consistently found that the strongest relation was between chimpanzee g scores and efficiency in the HDT. Chimpanzee g was not most closely related to the proportion of trials the chimpanzees chose to try to wait for delayed rewards, but rather most closely related to how good they were at waiting for those rewards when they chose to do so. We also found the same strong relation between HDT efficiency and those factors in the PCTB that loaded most strongly on chimpanzee g. These results highlight that, as with humans, there is a strong relation between chimpanzees’ self-control and overall intelligence—a relation that likely reflects the role of successful inhibitory control during cognitive processing of information and intelligent decision-making.},

Going beyond stereotypical presentations of Hindu temples dominated by chronological and stylistic themes, this study, addressed to architects, urbanists, and builders, combines historic scholarship, documentation, personal observations and fieldwork to expand the idea of the Hindu temple as a complex and contradictory cultural entity, that is both formal and informal, monumental and modest, historic and modern, and deserving of a far broader and deeper understanding.},

This point is illustrated by observations made among the Nunamiut Eskimo. Against this background it is demonstrated that the two most common forms of archaeological systematics, “assemblage”- versus “type”-based systematics, are not appropriate for the study of places. In the latter case, it is not possible to analyze places as such, while one cannot see places with different “content” as part of a single system in the former. It is concluded that current archaeological systematics are totally inappropriate for studying past systems of adaptation and their evolutionary modification.},

By drawing precise 'blueprints' with simple tools such as the compass and straightedge, Gothic draftsmen were able to develop a linearized architecture of unprecedented complexity and sophistication. Examination of their surviving drawings can provide valuable and remarkably intimate information about the Gothic design process. Gothic drawings include compass pricks, uninked construction lines, and other telltale traces of the draftsman's geometrically-based working method. This book offers a new perspective on Gothic architectural creativity. It shows, in a series of rigorous geometrical case studies, how Gothic design evolved over time, in two senses: in the hours of the draftsman's labor, and across the centuries of the late Middle Ages"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of architecture without reducing architecture to politics?},

Cities draw visitors because of their exquisite architecture, walkable neighborhoods, and human scale. Yet a great deal of the knowledge and practice behind successful city planning has been abandoned over the last hundred years--not because of traffic, population growth, or other practical hurdles, but because of ill-considered theories. An accomplished architect and urbanist goes back to the roots of what makes cities attractive and livable, demonstrating how we can restore function and beauty to our urban spaces for the long term.--},

Assembled here for the first time, these offer an insightful overview of the subject, ranging from the earliest mosques and tombs erected by the Delhi sultans in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, to the great monuments of the Mughal emperors dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. The articles cover the principal forms of Indian Islamic architecture -- mosques, tombs, minarets, forts, gateways and water structures -- as well as the most important sites and their monuments. Unsurpassed for their compression of information, these succinct articles serve as the best possible introduction to the subject, indispensible for both students and travellers. The articles are supplemented by a portfolio of photographs especially selected for the volume, as well as a glossary and up to date bibliography.},

Dois dos contextos de estudo em que essa relação é mais abordada são os da educação e da saúde, este último especificamente ao nível da promoção de comportamentos saudáveis e da prevenção de riscos.

The earliest cities were loci of the royal lineages, which were the apex of the newly created class structure. The basic exploitative technology underwent little change from the Neolithic to the Shang, and the emergence of the great Shang civilization was based on a reorganized distribution of wealth, which enabled the concentration of society's resources in the hands of the ruling class. Ironically, while much of the greatest material achievement in Shang civilization - or perhaps any civilization - is wasteful in terms of human needs, in posterity such achievements honour all the people they represent, the ruler and the ruled. Is greatness possible only in such terms, or are the archaeologist's criteria for greatness cockeyed in the first place?},

  abstract = {Questo articolo prende in considerazione l'evidenza archeologica e documentaria per l'uso delle abitazioni a Roma dal 500 al 1000 d. C. Le fonti (il Liber Pontificialis, registri papali, iscrizioni, documenti di proprietà) suggeriscono che, contrariamente all'opinione comune, gli edifici abitativi erano diffusi quanto le molte chiese della città. È solo dal decimo secolo che la popolazione cominciò a diffondersi nel Campo Marzio, precedentemente considerato il centro dell'abitato dalle guerre gotiche in poi. L'evidenza archeologica suggerisce che molte tracce dell'architettura domestica sono state trovate, e continueranno ad essere trovate, nell'area monumentale centrale, a Trastevere, sull'Aventino, il Celio e le parti orientali della città. La precisa natura architettonica delle abitazioni è rappresentata da una riutilizzazione degli edifici domestici e pubblici romani (esempi includono la Basilica Emilia, la cosiddetta Basilica Argentaria, il Ludus Magnus e VAtrium Vestae). È probabile che nuove informazioni possano venire da un'analisi delle strutture soprawiventi all'interno dei monasteri medievali della città e da scavi quali quello attualmente in corso nel Foro di Nerva.},

This paper argues that such a building is no more characteristic of peasant life in early modern Japan than is the "traditional Japanese family." Both are creations which came into existence during the early modern period (1600-1868), but which only reached their fullest realization at the beginning of this century. This paper uses a variety of sources, including maps and housing surveys, to trace the intertwined emergence of these two forms.},

  abstract = {We analyze the processing of cereals and its role at Early Neolithic Göbekli Tepe, southeastern Anatolia (10th / 9th millennium BC), a site that has aroused much debate in archaeological discourse. To date, only zooarchaeological evidence has been discussed in regard to the subsistence of its builders. Göbekli Tepe consists of monumental round to oval buildings, erected in an earlier phase, and smaller rectangular buildings, built around them in a partially contemporaneous and later phase. The monumental buildings are best known as they were in the focus of research. They are around 20 m in diameter and have stone pillars that are up to 5.5 m high and often richly decorated. The rectangular buildings are smaller and–in some cases–have up to 2 m high, mostly undecorated, pillars. Especially striking is the number of tools related to food processing, including grinding slabs/bowls, handstones, pestles, and mortars, which have not been studied before. We analyzed more than 7000 artifacts for the present contribution. The high frequency of artifacts is unusual for contemporary sites in the region. Using an integrated approach of formal, experimental, and macro- / microscopical use-wear analyses we show that Neolithic people at Göbekli Tepe have produced standardized and efficient grinding tools, most of which have been used for the processing of cereals. Additional phytolith analysis confirms the massive presence of cereals at the site, filling the gap left by the weakly preserved charred macro-rests. The organization of work and food supply has always been a central question of research into Göbekli Tepe, as the construction and maintenance of the monumental architecture would have necessitated a considerable work force. Contextual analyses of the distribution of the elements of the grinding kit on site highlight a clear link between plant food preparation and the rectangular buildings and indicate clear delimitations of working areas for food production on the terraces the structures lie on, surrounding the circular buildings. There is evidence for extensive plant food processing and archaeozoological data hint at large-scale hunting of gazelle between midsummer and autumn. As no large storage facilities have been identified, we argue for a production of food for immediate use and interpret these seasonal peaks in activity at the site as evidence for the organization of large work feasts.},

Vernacular passive strategies can play an important role in helping reducing energy use and CO2 emissions related to buildings. This paper studies the use of glazed balconies in the North of Portugal as a strategy to capture solar gains and reduce heat losses. The purpose is understanding thermal performance and comfort conditions provided by this passive heating strategy. The methodology includes objective (short and long-term monitoring), to evaluate the different parameters affecting thermal comfort and air quality, and subjective assessments to assess occupants\&rsquo; perception regarding thermal sensation. The results show that the use of glazed balconies as a passive heating strategy in a climate with cold winters is viable. During the mid-seasons, the rooms with balcony have adequate comfort conditions. In the heating season, it is possible to achieve comfort conditions in sunny days while in the cooling season there is a risk of overheating. Regarding indoor air quality, carbon dioxide concentrations were low, but the average radon concentration measured was high when the building was unoccupied, rapidly decreasing to acceptable values, during occupation periods when a minimum ventilation rate was promoted. Occupants\&rsquo; actions were essential to improving building behavior.},

Il est en particulier l’auteur de Dessin-chantier (2005, éd. de la Villette), ouvrage dérangeant par sa critique radicale des conditions de production de l’architecture en même temps que pensée originale pour une pratique émancipatrice du métier. L’ouvrage de Sérgio Ferro repose sur une trajectoire brésilienne peu connue en France et pourtant déterminante, initiée pendant la construction de Brasilia au sein d’un trio de jeunes architectes de Sao Paulo, et dont la contribution architecturale et théorique s’inscrit dans le Brésil des années 1960. Cette trajectoire se confond aussi plus largement avec celle d’une avant-garde intellectuelle et artistique de gauche tiraillée par les tensions entre modernité et sous-développement, perspectives de transformations sociales et résistance au régime militaire d’après 1964. L’article propose alors une « lecture brésilienne » du texte Dessin-chantier en retraçant le récit de cette trajectoire biographique d’avant l’exil et en évoquant l’héritage vivant dont les travaux théoriques de Ferro sur l’architecture font l’objet au Brésil ; ce faisant, il met en évidence la dimension fondamentalement politique de l’œuvre de Sérgio Ferro.},

He is an expert on every type of Chinese architecture from every period through the nineteenth century, and his work is at the cutting edge of the field. This wide-ranging book gathers together, for the first time in English, twelve seminal essays by Fu Xinian. It pays special attention to the technical aspects of the building tradition since the first millennium BC, and Fu Xinian's signature drawings abundantly illustrate its nuances. The essays delve into the modular basis for individual structures, complexes, and cities; lateral and longitudinal building frames; the unity of sculpture and building to create viewing angles; the influence of Chinese construction on Japanese architecture; and the reliability of images to inform us about architecture. Organized chronologically, the book also examines such topics as the representation of architecture on vessels in the Warring States period, early Buddhist architecture, and the evolution of imperial architecture from the Tang to Ming dynasty. A biography of Fu Xinian and a detailed Chinese-English glossary are included. Bringing together some of the most groundbreaking scholarship in Chinese architectural history, it showcases an uncontested master of the discipline.},

L’ampleur du programme urbanistique conduit par ces derniers au début du ve s. av. J.-C. est confirmée, tout autant que la destruction brutale qui affecte le site vers 480/470 av. J.-C. La morphologie de l’îlot suggère l’existence de maisons à plusieurs pièces et d’un plan orthonormé rigoureux. En revanche, une séquence antérieure inédite a ici été mise en évidence et correspond à la phase d’installation étrusque à proprement parler. Une division régulière du terrain précède la construction d’une maison absidiale en torchis dont le plan et la métrologie trouvent des parallèles probants en Étrurie padane. Cette succession entre une division foncière, une installation provisoire et un programme de lotissement urbain témoigne d’une véritable entreprise planifiée, qui doit être mise en rapport avec le regain de la dynamique commerciale des cités d’Étrurie méridionale à la fin du vie-début du ve s. av.

  abstract = {This paper offers a history of rammed-earth construction through the study of selected examples of Islamic defensive architecture in Spain. While earth construction differs from region to region and time to time during the period of Islamic domination in Spain, various examples share a number of common characteristics. The details of rammed-earth construction techniques in each historical epoch are analysed in terms of the dimensions of the earth boxes and their elements. The processes and the auxiliary elements of the formwork, and the role of putlog holes and beams are also studied. From this analysis a construction typology for Islamic earthworks is proposed. This differs from Medieval Christian rammed-earth construction which comprises a method using boxes and half putlogs which need a bracing system such as wedges, nails, ropes or Saint Andrew crosses. Finally, analysis of the modules and dimensions of the rammed-earth components reveals that two modules were used, one used during Emirate and Caliphate based on a dimension of a raššāší cubit (0.55 cm), the other used during the Almoravid, Almohad and Nasrid kingdoms based on a dimension of a ma’mūní cubit (c. 0.45 cm)..},

  abstract = {Islamic Art and Beyond is the third in a set of four volumes of studies on Islamic art by Oleg Grabar. Between them they bring together more than eighty articles, studies and essays, work spanning half a century by a master of the field. Each volume takes a particular section of the topic, the three other volumes being entitled: Early Islamic Art, 650-1100; Islamic Visual Culture, 1100-1800; and Jerusalem. Reflecting the many incidents of a long academic life, they illustrate one scholar's attempt at making order and sense of 1400 years of artistic growth. They deal with architecture, painting, objects, iconography, theories of art, aesthetics and ornament, and they seek to integrate our knowledge of Islamic art with Islamic culture and history as well as with the global concerns of the History of Art. In addition to the articles selected, each volume contains an introduction which describes, often in highly personal ways, the context in which Grabar's scholarship developed and the people who directed and mentored his efforts.  The articles in the present volume illustrate how the author's study of Islamic art led him in two directions for a further understanding of the arts. One is how to define Islamic art and what impulses provided it with its own peculiar forms and dynamics of growth. Was it a faith or a combination of social, historical, and cultural events? And how has 'Islamic art' impacted on the contemporary arts of the Islamic world? The other issue is that of the meanings to be given to forms like domes, so characteristic of Islamic art, or to terms like symbol, signs, or aesthetic values in the arts, especially when one considers the contemporary world. The Islamic examples allow for the development of new intellectual positions for the history and criticism of the arts everywhere.},

  abstract = {Between 10 and six thousand years ago the Arabian Peninsula saw the most recent of the ‘Green Arabia’ periods, when increased rainfall transformed this generally arid region. The transition to the Neolithic in Arabia occurred during this period of climatic amelioration. Various forms of stone structures are abundant in northern Arabia, and it has been speculated that some of these dated to the Neolithic, but there has been little research on their character and chronology. Here we report a study of 104 ‘mustatil’ stone structures from the southern margins of the Nefud Desert in northern Arabia. We provide the first chronometric age estimate for this type of structure – a radiocarbon date of ca. 5000\,BC – and describe their landscape positions, architecture and associated material culture and faunal remains. The structure we have dated is the oldest large-scale stone structure known from the Arabian Peninsula. The mustatil phenomenon represents a remarkable development of monumental architecture, as hundreds of these structures were built in northwest Arabia. This ‘monumental landscape’ represents one of the earliest large-scale forms of monumental stone structure construction anywhere in the world. Further research is needed to understand the function of these structures, but we hypothesise that they were related to rituals in the context of the adoption of pastoralism and resulting territoriality in the challenging environments of northern Arabia.},

A new look at the architectural remains and the stratigraphy resulted in an alternative reconstruction, essentially different than the one we have come to know. We used spatial (architectural-geometrical) analysis in order to study the relationships between the different architectural elements and to test our hypothesis that the series of postholes may have not pertained to the upper floor 131 of Layer IV as suggested by Perrot and Valla, but rather to the successive occupational and architectural episode. The association of the postholes with Wall 51 of Layer III sheds new light on the architectural remains revealing their geometric design, an important characteristic of Early Natufian Architecture, the meaning and implications of which we shortly discuss.},

The excavation since 1995 has been accompanied by a lively discussion about the meaning and implications of its remarkable early Neolithic megalithic architecture, unprecedented in its monumentality, complexity and symbolic content. The building history and the chronological relations between the different structures (enclosures), however, remain in many ways a challenge and open to further analysis. The study presented here is an attempt to contribute in this direction by applying a preliminary architectural formal analysis in order to reconstruct aspects of the architectural design processes involved in the construction of the monumental enclosures. This is done under the premise that such investigation would shed light on the chaîne opératoire of the enclosures' construction and their history, thus enabling a fresh look as well as an evaluation of past suggestions regarding these structures and the people who built them. Indeed, the results of the analysis brought to light an underlying geometric pattern which offers a new understanding of the assemblage of architectural remains indicating that three of the stone-built large enclosures were planned and initially built as a single project.},

Poor climatic conditions at the end of the 13th century undermined sacred leaders at Mapungubwe itself, and while vulnerable, the elite at Great Zimbabwe took over the important gold and ivory trade. Among other things, the new elite used the unique Zimbabwe birdstones to establish their legitimacy.},

  abstract = {Many archaeologists investigated the burial practices of the Jomon in order to clarify emerging social complexity, especially in the 1950s. Recently, since the social complexity of the Jomon became an important issue, burial practice has been recognised as an indicator of a hereditary ranking system. As I have noted elsewhere, there is no clear evidence that a hereditary ranking system existed in Jomon society. However, instead of searching for hereditary ranking in the Jomon, burial practices could be analysed from another aspect. The temporal and regional distribution of Jomon burial practices has been clarified. In the Kanto district, communal graves appeared in the early Late Jomon. This type of burial has been discovered only in this area. In the same period, some burial practices also appeared in other areas of Eastern Japan. Although this change from Middle to Late Jomon has been recognised, it has not been investigated from the perspective of social complexity. In this paper, I will try to examine the change in burial practices from the Middle to the Late Jomon in terms of social complexity.},

A landmark work of impressive scope, the book is enhanced by 700 halftone illustrations and 150 drawings especially prepared by architect Richard Tobias. Kostof's range of study includes not only the monumental religious, governmental and upper-class structures around which architectural history has usually been written but also the diversity of ordinary domestic, rural, and urban buildings, and landscapes which surround them. Moreover, Kostof evaluates Western achievement in the context of contemporary cultures elsewhere. Thus he discusses the high points of imperial Rome along with Buddhist stupas and Han palaces, compares medieval Florence with medieval Cairo, and introduces Inca and Aztec cities as the Spanish conquistadores would have seen them. The author's premise is that buldings are conditioned by the social, economic, and political frame of their time; in this sense, Kostof concludes, the history of architecture can be considered an aspect of the history of human institutions. "Architecture, in the end," he writes, "is nothing less than the gift of making places for some human purpose."},

  abstract = {Abstract             Self-control underlies cognitive abilities such as decision making and future planning. Delay of gratification is a measure of self-control and involves obtaining a more valuable outcome in the future by tolerating a delay or investing a greater effort in the present. Contextual issues, such as reward visibility and type, may influence delayed gratification performance, although there has been limited comparative investigation between humans and other animals, particularly non-primate species. Here, we adapted an automated ‘rotating tray’ paradigm used previously with capuchin monkeys to test for delay of gratification ability that requires little pre-test training, where the subject must forgo an immediate, less preferred reward for a delayed, more preferred one. We tested New Caledonian crows and 3–5-year-old human children. We manipulated reward types to differ in quality or quantity (Experiments 1 and 2) as well as visibility (Experiment 2). In Experiments 1 and 2, both species performed better when the rewards varied in quality as opposed to quantity, though performed above chance in both conditions. In Experiment 1, both crows and children were able to delay gratification when both rewards were visible. In Experiment 2, 5-year-old children outperformed 3- and 4-year olds, though overall children still performed well, while the crows struggled when reward visibility was manipulated, a result which may relate to difficulties in tracking the experimenters’ hands during baiting. We discuss these findings in relation to the role of contextual issues on self-control when making species comparisons and investigating the mechanisms of self-control.},

  abstract = {Even after more than 250 years since its discovery, Pompeii continues to resonate powerfully in both academic discourse and the popular imagination. This volume brings together a collection of ten papers that advance, challenge and revise the present conceptions of the city's art, industry and infrastructure. The discussions of domestic art in this book, a perennial topic for Pompeian scholars, engage previously neglected subjects such as wall ornaments in domestic decoration, the sculpture collection in the house of Octavius Quartio, and the role of the covered walkways in luxury villa architecture. The famous cupid's frieze from the house of the Vettii is given a novel and intelligent reinterpretation. The place of industry at Pompeii, in both the physical and economic landscapes has long been overlooked. The chapters on building practice in inhabited houses, on the presence of fulling workshops in atrium houses, and on the urban pottery industry serve as successful contributions to a more complete understanding of the life of the ancient city. Finally, this volume breaks new ground in the consideration of the urban infrastructure of Pompeii, a topic that has won serious attention only in the last decades, but one that is playing an increasingly central role in Pompeian studies. The final three chapters offer a reassessment of the Pompeian street network, a scientific analysis of the amount of lead in Pompeian drinking water, and a thorough analysis of the water infrastructure around the forum that supported its architectural transformation in the last decades before the eruption of mount Vesuvius in AD 79.},

Nowadays only are conserved the remains of some abandoned ovens used in the process. This article is the consequence of an interview carried out to Mr. Rubio, who worked in the lime ovens since his childhood, and whose testimony is very important to understand how the derived processes of that kind of mining was, and also its anthropological dimension.},

  abstract = {Intensive but localized cultivation of cereal crops on alluvial wetlands is thought to have provided the ecological basis for the primary Neolithic settlement that spread across southwest Asia and southeast Europe. New excavations at Çatalhöyük provide an opportunity to test this horticultural model via multiple data sources. Geoarchaeological studies show that the main Neolithic occupation coincided with a period of active river alluviation. Most of the area surrounding Çatalhöyük was therefore under floodwaters each spring that would have seriously damaged any autumn‐sown cereal crops. Independent evidence that the cereal crops consumed at Çatalhöyük were grown under rain‐fed conditions derives from the paucity of silicified multicellular wheat phytoliths at the site. Together, these and other data suggest that the bulk of the cereal agriculture was not carried out in the immediate vicinity of Çatalhöyük but was at least 13 km and 3 h away in dryland soils. In turn, this implies that there may have been seasonal fission and fusion of Çatalhöyük’s population, with systematic exploitation of, and impact on, a range of different ecological zones. This phase of nucleated settlement ended when river flooding ceased, coincident with a multidecadal drought from 6300 to 6140 BC.},

  abstract = {When classical elastic analysis fails to model correctly the structural behavior of historical masonry structures because of the brittle, rigid, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous characteristics of their building material, equilibrium-based limit state analysis constitutes an efficient alternative for their structural assessment. The lack of knowledge about the history of loading makes the actual state of stresses impossible to determine for these statically indeterminate structures. However, Plastic Theory provides a powerful theoretical framework that defines in a rather simple way the structural safety level. The lower-bound theorem of plasticity can be applied using graphic statics because it ensures that equilibrium and yield conditions are respected when applying specific constraints to the nodes of the reciprocal diagrams.This article focuses on limit stat analysis of statically indeterminate structures by means of geometrical considerations using graphic statics reciprocal diagrams. For linear-bended structures, we show that: (1) the conditions of stability can be defined graphically by constructing safety domains; (2) collapse modes can be identified and related to specific reciprocal polygons; and (3) the exact value of the collapse load factor can be deduced graphically from the diagrams. Finally, we extend these results to plane masonry arches in relation with the classical thrust line approach.},

  abstract = {The history of mudbrick production and construction in the southern Levant may be dated as far back to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. However, at many of the sites where mudbrick remains were noted, their preservation was poor, so investigation of their production and the related construction techniques in antiquity was precluded. The 7,200 year old (cal BP) site of Tel Tsaf, located in the Jordan Valley, is distinguished by outstanding preservation of mudbrick architecture, which enables us to delve into various issues related to mudbrick technology, construction and preservation. The present paper discusses some of the mudbrick features at Tel Tsaf and their characteristics and offers a comprehensive analytical study of the mudbricks from multiple contexts and phases. These demonstrate consistency in three of the four measured variables: magnetic susceptibility, organic content and calcium carbonate equivalent. The results of our study suggest that while we can identify morphometric variability between bricks and walls, by and large, a uniform composition characterized the tested assemblages without any temporal or spatial variability. This indicates that a single locally-sourced raw material was used and that recycling of old decayed mudbricks was likely practiced. The consistency of mudbrick-production during all phases of the occupation at Tel Tsaf and the absence of multiple recipes implies that a shared production and technological know-how was maintained for at least 500 years at the site.},

Indeed, many scholars have seen the treatise's passage on art (Apol 28-29) as a description of art as it existed at Cluny at the time of the writing of the Apologia (probably 1125). In confronting the question, this article briefly takes up a number of issues, including the belief that the Apologia was specifically addressed to the abbey of Cluny, that Bernard was either strongly repulsed by or strongly attracted to art, and that Apol 29 is a description of actual cloister sculpture, most notably that of the cloister of Pons at Cluny. Instead, the passage which has been seen as a description of the cloister of Pons is explained as a critique of certain elements of art as a spiritual distraction--the implication being that a reformulation of our artistic conception of Cluny is long overdue, and that the criticism of art contained in the Apologia played a larger role than that of merely acting as a censure of artworks as they existed at Cluny.},

  abstract = {Islam is seen by many scholars as an urban religion, which favours communal practice on individual worship. Although, piety is the only source of appraisal, it is widely accepted that most of Islam's teaching is best practised in an urban setting. It is not surprising that Islam made particular emphasis on the form and design of the city enabling it a greater functionality and responsiveness to meet the socio-economic and cultural needs of the community. This article presents an analysis of the spatial and functional arrangements of the Islamic city and assesses their socio-cultural meanings.},

  abstract = {The vault over the crossing at Pisa cathedral is elliptical in plan and has an exposed exterior profile. These characteristics, unique in 11th-century Tuscany, have caused scholars to doubt that the dome could have been built as part of the original cathedral fabric, which was largely complete by 1118. Yet Sanpaolesi's recent discussion of the problem, based on his study of the cupola during its restoration in 1957, presents substantial evidence in support of an early date (1090-1100) for the squinches and tambour below the cupola proper, and he argues convincingly that the cupola itself must share this date. Acceptance of his conclusions, however, does not necessitate assuming that the cupola was foreseen when the cathedral was planned in 1063, or that its original appearance conformed to what we see today. Indeed, I will argue that the unusual shape of the cupola is the inevitable consequence of a decision to vault the crossing, taken after the foundations of the cathedral were already laid. Further, I will present evidence which suggests that the exterior profile of the dome was not exposed originally, and has only been exposed since the late 14th century. Finally, I will show that in its original form the cupola was closely related to contemporary Lombard structures.},

This article takes as its focus halls built at palatial or religious complexes in north China during the Yuan period to determine if a period style can be defined within the homogeneous timber frame building tradition. Studying the buildings and their details through surviving architecture and fragments, contemporary descriptions, and contemporary painting, the investigation concludes that, although the Yuan period may be termed transitional, its buildings are more closely allied with the pre-Yuan than the post-Yuan period, especially as the earlier style is known from the illustrated construction manual Yingzao Fashi.},

The nation's architectural achievements range from its earliest walled cities and the First Emperor's vision of city and empire, to bridges, pagodas, and the twentieth-century constructions of the Socialist state. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt presents the first fully comprehensive survey of Chinese architecture in any language. With rich political and historical context, Steinhardt covers forty centuries of architecture, from the genesis of Chinese building through to the twenty-first century and the challenges of urban expansion and globalism. Steinhardt follows the extraordinary breadth of China's architectural legacy--including excavation sites, gardens, guild halls, and relief sculpture--and considers the influence of Chinese architecture on Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet. Architectural examples from Chinese ethnic populations and various religions are examined, such as monasteries, mosques, observatories, and tombs. Steinhardt also shows that Chinese architecture is united by a standardized system of construction, applicable whether buildings are temples, imperial palaces, or shrines. Every architectural type is based on the models that came before it, and principles established centuries earlier dictate building practices. China's unique system has allowed its built environment to stand as a profound symbol of Chinese culture},

  doi = {10.17863/CAM.13968},
  abstract = {Human beings of all cultures build some form of shelter, and the global distribution of Homo sapiens depends on this basic trait. All great apes (chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, and orangutan) build analogous structures (called nests or beds) at least once a day throughout their adult lives, which suggests that this elementary technology was present before the hominid lines separated. This thesis investigates the variability and function of specifically wild chimpanzee shelters.  I compared characteristics of chimpanzee nests, nesting trees, nest shape, and architecture in two savanna-dwelling populations on opposite sides of Africa: Fongoli, Senegal, and Issa, Tanzania. Savanna habitats are the most extreme habitats in which chimpanzees survive today, and may represent a similar environment to that in which early hominins evolved in the Plio-Pleistocene (Chapter 2). Investigating variation in nest-building within and between these two extreme habitats made it possible to tackle hypotheses of the shelter function of nests (Chapter 3).  The influence of environment, specifically the role of protection from disease vectors and fluctuating temperatures, was assessed through a novel experiment in which I slept overnight in arboreal chimpanzee nests and on the bare earth (Chapter 4). To assess whether or not nests serve as an anti-predation function, I compared nesting in Issa, where predators are abundant, to Fongoli, where they are absent (Chapter 5). I provided further support for the thermoregulatory function of nests by showing that chimpanzees build more insulating nests in adverse weather conditions (Chapter 6).  Nest-building is a learned behaviour, but its ontogeny is little known. I investigated social sources of variation in nest building in Fongoli to examine whether sex and age differences exist in nest building duration, nest position, shape and architecture (Chapter 7).  Finally, ecosystem engineering is a consequence of animal construction, from ants to humans. I investigated use-wear traces around nests to assess niche construction of nest- building. I showed that chimpanzees repeatedly re-used these specific nest-spots within trees, which are pre-fabricated for future building through repeated pruning and shaping of these structures (Chapter 8).  Nest building in great apes may be the foundation of constructivity in hominids. This thesis describes proximate functions and influences on nest-building variation in wild chimpanzees that help to model the evolution of shelter in hominids.},

After 1200, in the original construction of all High Gothic churches, only rectangular-planned, quadripartite vaults were used. Previous explanations for this phenomenon have focused primarily on the stylistic implications of the change in vault configuration, while others have pointed to certain constructional differences. Yet none of these adequately explain the sudden shift. This paper, based on an analysis of the structural forces developed during high vault construction, offers a new theory that clearly points to the reason for the obsolescence of the sexpartite systems for the later buildings.},

  abstract = {Many scholars have speculated on the shape of the first great dome on Justinian's Hagia Sophia, which was demolished in 558 after a partial collapse the year before. Rowland Mainstone has suggested that it was a shallow structure, anchored directly to the upper cornice at the culmination of the pendentives. His basis for assuming this profile is John Malalas's testimony that the new dome was constructed 20 feet higher than the first dome, which would thereby have been a full two-fifths shallower than its replacement. By accepting Malalas's testimony almost too eagerly, modern scholars subvert the eyewitness account in Procopius's The Buildings, which makes clear reference to a "rounded structure" resting on the main arches and standing below the dome itself. Such a structure, which according to Procopius contain the dome's windows, can only be interpreted as a drum. Procopius refers in almost identical terms to the central dome of the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, taking pains to draw a parallel here with the drum of Hagia Sophia. Both churches, he attests, have this same "circular structure" resting upon the arches and penetrated by the windows. A later literary source confirms that the Holy Apostles did indeed have drums under its five domes, and most prominently under the central dome. If St. Sophia's drum accommodated the full height of the windows, and provided sufficient headroom for persons walking upon the cornice, it might well have been ten feet high or more. Malalas's 20-foot differential, if it is reliable in the first place, is not violated by this hypothesis; for it could refer simply to the relative depths of the first and second domes, while ignoring the lesser change in elevation implied by raising the first, shallower dome on a drum.},

  abstract = {Construction of the Cathedral or Duomo of S. Maria del Fiore began in Florence in 1293/94, reached the stage of rising masonry by 1296, and had progressed so well by 1300 that the Florentine city council authorized a lifetime tax exemption for its founding architect, Arnolfo di Cambio. But at some moment after this auspicious start ill-fortune intervened: by 1310 Arnolfo was dead and work on his project suspended. Refounded as a new project in a series of committee decisions in the years 1357-1368, Florence Cathedral is generally regarded as anonymous or collective in authorship. Its fame rests not on Arnolfo's abandoned and unrecorded project but on the prodigious cupola erected by Filippo Brunelleschi from 1420 to 1436, Europe's first major dome since antiquity and chief harbinger of the Italian Renaissance. In 1978 the author presented excavation results that questioned the Brunelleschi-centered tradition and reinforced instead a persistent counter-tradition which attributes the basic features of the 1368 plan and of Brunelleschi's cupola to Arnolfo's original project of ca. 1293-1296. That preliminary hypothesis in favor of Arnolfo as conceptual author of Florence Cathedral is now strengthened by the results of a second Duomo excavation in 1980. The new findings, together with a reappraisal of the documentary evidence and a set of reconstruction drawings, are submitted here as a second and longer look at the project that changed the course of European architecture.},

This paper examines the drawing and text of a Sienese building contract of 1340, and concludes that execution by remote control was already a significant part of the culture of Gothic architects.},

  abstract = {When it becomes clear that a given interpretative model (or set of criteria) contains irreducible contradictions and is incapable of resolving certain stubborn problems, it is time for a new paradigm. Recognizing that scholarship on Gothic architecture has long since reached this impasse, this study identifies new terms of understanding in the oppositional pair "modernism" and "historicism." These two transhistorical concepts are found to offer numerous interpretative advantages over such traditional categories as "skeletal form," "diaphaneity," "linearity," "diagonality," "square schematism," and the like, all of which are severely burdened by the well known constrictive problematics of "style," among other difficulties. Properly defined and understood, the modernism/historicism paradigm is shown to offer numerous advantages in studying medieval architecture across a wide range of concerns, from descriptive, componential, and formal analysis to social, intellectual, and contextual integration. The entire apparatus of the great cathedrals is seen in a radically new, comprehensive way, and such intractable historical problems as that of the seemingly oxymoronic "Gothic column" are resolved. The proposed paradigm is further explored and tested regarding both word and image in medieval architecture, in a new reading of the controversial texts of Abbot Suger on Saint-Denis, and in a revised solution to the Bourges "problem."},

  abstract = {Since Alberti, and most critically since Wittkower’s Architectural Principles, architectural theory has tended to construe ‘proportions’ in plenary, static terms. The dimension of time and change that relentlessly affects all human endeavor is not accommodated by the celebrated Albertian ideal of immutable design perfection, so perfect in all respects that once attained ‘nothing can be added, taken away, or altered, but for the worse’. This article, drawing on the author’s recent book, Building-in-Time from Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (Yale, 2010), outlines the antithetical, dynamic proportional methodology of the pre-Albertian architectural regime. Its point of departure was the author’s concept of durational aesthetics, according to which perfected architectural form is produced by a process of incessant revision. What distinguished this process from related ancient or neo-antique doctrines was above all its dynamic modality and participation in the fluid orientation and processes of ‘building-in-time’.},

  abstract = {The residential mobility patterns of modern hunter-gatherers broadly reflect local resource availability, but the proximate ecological and social forces that determine the timing of camp movements are poorly known. We tested the hypothesis that the timing of such moves maximizes foraging efficiency as hunter-gatherers move across the landscape. The marginal value theorem predicts when a group should depart a camp and its associated foraging area and move to another based on declining marginal return rates. This influential model has yet to be directly applied in a population of hunter-gatherers, primarily because the shape of gain curves (cumulative resource acquisition through time) and travel times between patches have been difficult to estimate in ethnographic settings. We tested the predictions of the marginal value theorem in the context of hunter-gatherer residential mobility using historical foraging data from nomadic, socially egalitarian Batek hunter-gatherers (n = 93 d across 11 residential camps) living in the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. We characterized the gain functions for all resources acquired by the Batek at daily timescales and examined how patterns of individual foraging related to the emergent property of residential movements. Patterns of camp residence times conformed well with the predictions of the marginal value theorem, indicating that communal perceptions of resource depletion are closely linked to collective movement decisions. Despite (and perhaps because of) a protracted process of deliberation and argument about when to depart camps, Batek residential mobility seems to maximize group-level foraging efficiency.},

  abstract = {The Orders, the long-time emblematic centerpiece of architectural education, were banished from studio in the United States a half-century ago. They were exiled to the curriculum's sparse offerings in history when the Bauhaus system of education in architecture displaced the Beaux Arts system. The Orders stand for an entire system of design based on recognizable building components, proportionality, and coherence. Their presence would improve the formal qualities of designs across the entire spectrum from buildings addressing the increased interest in traditional qualities in buildings to those pushing forward the legacy of Modernism's founders, men who themselves knew the Orders well.},
